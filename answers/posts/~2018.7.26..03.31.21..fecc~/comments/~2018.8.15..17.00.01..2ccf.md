Your problem is actually just due to a typo: you have `$(s t.l)` which fails because `l` doesn't exist. You want `$(s t.s)` instead.

When you declare a gate, it does a type-check pass to verify the gate's body is valid. In both `++turn-dry` and `++turn-wet`, for example, it uses your provided mold of `s=(list)` and thus has access to `i.s` and `t.s`, so the body is fine. When you call the gate, Hoon casts your arguments to the type of your gate's sample, verifying that they are subtypes: in your case, `^-  $-(* *)  |=(a=@ a)` will nest-fail, so you can't call `++turn-dry` with that.

For the wet case, however, Hoon does *another* type-check at each callsite (not just the first), replacing the gate's mold with the *actual* arguments type and verifying that works. That call for `++turn-wet` then becomes `|=  [s=~ a=$-(@ @)]  ...` for example, Hoon type-checks, and everything comes out ok. This lets Hoon use the type of your specialized function call for the return result, instead of using the return type it inferred from the declaration site.
