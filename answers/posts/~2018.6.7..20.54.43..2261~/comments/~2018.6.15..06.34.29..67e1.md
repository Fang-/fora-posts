My samefringe (`~taglux-nidsep`'s) has a problem.  If there is an extra 0 at the end of one of the nouns, but they are otherwise the same in 'fringe', the function will mistakenly treat them as identical.

`tonlur-sarret`'s samefringe also has a problem.  If the `b` noun has fewer leaves than the `a` noun, the function will crash.

Here is my updated samefringe, no attempt at fancy use of the `=^` rune this time (sad!):

```
|=  [a=* b=*]
^-  ?
?:  =(a b)  &
?@  a  |
?@  b  |
?^  -.a  $(a [-<.a ->.a +.a])
?^  -.b  $(b [-<.b ->.b +.b])
?:(=(-.a -.b) $(a +.a, b +.b) |)
```
