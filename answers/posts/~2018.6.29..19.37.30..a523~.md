Let T be a `(tree @)` (see `++  tree` in `hoon.hoon`).  Here's an example tree:

```
> `(tree @)`[n=11 l=[n=22 l=~ r=~] r=[n=33 l=~ r=~]]
{22 11 33}
```

##### Write a Hoon program that searches T head-first for some atom A and replaces the (first copy of) A with another atom B.

##### Write another program that replaces *all* instances of atom A with atom B in T.

##### Write a program that takes some `(tree @)` and returns `%.y` if it's balanced and `%.n` if it isn't.  A tree T is balanced if and only if for every node of T the number of left and right (non-null) 'child nodes' differs at most by `1`.
