After a breach, you boot it the same way you did the first time: 

```
urbit -w sampel-palnet -t sampel-sompel-simpel-sampel
```

You'll have to wait until the next network reset to boot your planet, unfortunately. Eventually there will be a way to restart a planet without a breach, but that hasn't been implemented yet.
