Nice!  Your samefringe is shorter than mine.  I decided to use the `=^` rune:

```
=<
|=  [a=* b=*]
^-  ?
?:  =(a b)  &                  ::  if a and b are the same, 'yes'
=^  g  a  (next-leaf a)        ::  take left-most leaf, g, out of a
=^  h  b  (next-leaf b)        ::  take left-most leaf, h, out of b
?:(=(g h) $ |)                 ::  if g=h then try next leaf, else 'no'
::
|%
++  next-leaf                  ::  take left-most leaf out of noun
  |=  c=*
  ^-  [@ *]                    ::  return pair of [atom modified-noun]
  ?@  c  [c ~]
  ?@  -.c  [-.c +.c]
  $(c [-<.c [->.c +.c]])
