This is certainly something we can keep in mind. I have watched the presentation by gustafson, and they have already one company designing hardware for posits. 
As Urbit matures we will want scientific computing stuff, this would be a perfect start for this. 

There is also a julia package which has software implementation of posits it seems, which could be a start.
