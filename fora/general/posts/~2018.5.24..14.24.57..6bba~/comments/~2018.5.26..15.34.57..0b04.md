"~zod not responding still trying" means there's a connectivity issue; take the usual steps to make sure you have access to the internet, that your firewall isn't blocking all your UDP ports, etc. You'll know that it's connecting properly when you see "~zod is your neighbor" and "~zod is ok".

Be advised that once it's connected that "awaiting hood" step can still take 15min or longer, depending on network traffic and probably other things as well.
