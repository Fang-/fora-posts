Would endorsements extend to comets? I know they are supposed to be disposable, but I can think of several situations where endorsing a comet would be valuable. For instance in the future, when URBIT has gone from wildly successful to taken for granted infrastructure, available planets will be scarce. In that case, young adults might start out with a comet.  
A child might be given a moon so he can interact with the urbitverse, but still be under supervision. But no self respecting teen would settle for that (The shame!)  When forging out into the world he would get himself a comet and have his parents, school guidance councillor, etc. endorse it so he's not automatically shunned from the more reputable neighbourhoods. That way, he takes his first step towards infospace independence and his dream of one day owning his very own planet.
