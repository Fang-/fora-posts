This is something that you run manually to generate a site — so when something changes you'd need to run it again. There's no live updating, although that wouldn't be too difficult to add.

`udon` is a bit weird — but it allows us to use hoon within a markdown-like file, which is really cool. Especially for things like including other files. Compared to Jekyll / frontmatter / yaml, I think it's much much better.
