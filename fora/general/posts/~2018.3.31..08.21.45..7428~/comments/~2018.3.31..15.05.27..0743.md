For FreeBSD: [https://www.freshports.org/devel/libsigsegv/](https://www.freshports.org/devel/libsigsegv/).

For OS X, if you have homebrew:

```
brew install libsigsegv
```

Better yet, install all the urbit dependencies:

```
brew install --only-dependencies urbit
```

If you don't have homebrew: [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/).

Or, if you really don't want it, you can start building dependencies individually, starting here [https://www.gnu.org/software/libsigsegv/](https://www.gnu.org/software/libsigsegv/) (although you'll undoubtedly need more).
