Hi,

Yesterday installed an urbit instance on macOS and all went smoothly like the setup instructions explained. Today decided to boot another instance on a Digital Ocean VM and hit a small hiccup during the installation. 

The suggested install step failed: 
urbit@urbit:~/urbit$ sudo ninja -C ./build/ meson-install
ninja: Entering directory `./build/'
ninja: error: unknown target 'meson-install'

Running `urbit@urbit:~/urbit$ ninja -C ./build/ install` did the trick for me.

Wondering if anyone faced the same issue and if it something worth updating in the documentation?
