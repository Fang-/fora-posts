Yup. `=/  a=@  1  a` working but not `=/  [a=@ b=@]  [1 2]  a` is basically what I'm talking about. One of the places it stands out is if a gate returns two values: +trim for example returns two values with faces, so you can just use `=+` for that, but if you try to use +rads:og (or any state machine) manually you'll have to have the values behind another face.

```
=/  r  (~(rads og %entropy) 10)
:: have to access values with axises
-.r
```

instead of

```
=/  [p=@ q=_og]  (~(rads og %entropy) 10)
p
```

as far as I know, you have to use `=+  ^-  [p=@ q=_og]  (~(rads og %entropy) 10)  p` for that, which `=/` was made specifically to replace.
