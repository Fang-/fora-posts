Hello err-body.  I gave a talk at LambdaConf last week.  It was my first talk anywhere, and we had some technical difficulties at the beginning that ate up a good chunk of time.

However, I turned my notes and slides into an article of sorts, and you can read here:

Consider this the "director's cut" of the talk.

Any questions, comments, or suggestions are welcome!
