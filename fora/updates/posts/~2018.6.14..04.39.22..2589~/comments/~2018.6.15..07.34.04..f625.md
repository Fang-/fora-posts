I think the only thing we should worry is the unresolved permanent inability of geth to sync the client: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/issues/15753,
which increasingly seems to be linked to some emergent problems in the ETH network with regard to its scaling. 

I think just being "aware of the potential of an Ethereum network failure" and maybe emphasizing that in the long term Urbit is going to become self-hosted is good enough IMO. We definitely should avoid any advertisement of Urbit as being supportive of ETH in any capacity except for using is a temporary tool to host the constitution.

With looming scaling and legal problems on the horizon (the latter in US at least), if at some point ETH goes down in flames it would be nice to avoid damaging Urbit brand by association.
