"It doesn't feel right to do this at all when the documentation is completely inadequate, because it's not fair to people who don't have the time to reverse engineer. But we're thinking hard about this issue."

What do you mean by this? Some people can afford to pay in fiat, others with the time they put in to reverse engineer and build something. It's more unfair to consider the latter to have the same value as a contribution from someone less self sufficient (since you have to put in the time and effort to document, you've already compensated them). You guys should keep rewarding early contributors.
