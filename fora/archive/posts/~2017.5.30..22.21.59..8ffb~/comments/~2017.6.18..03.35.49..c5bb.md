The WeChat vector is best. Facebook is trying to become WeChat in the western hemisphere, so soon you'll be able to give a similar elevator pitch and pick between either FB or WeChat as the canonical examples.

I like using personal convenience and greed as the twin engines to snag consumer interest; FB/WC address the first, and "your own data" address the second, and the first in a more nuanced manner (i.e. your own reliable, searchable data repository). "Fun" is an oft-overlooked 3rd pillar, but that requires a horde of designers with their fingers on the pulse.
