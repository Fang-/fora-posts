Urbit has long had the [ability to tweet](https://twitter.com/urbit_test). The
`%eyre` vane has security drivers, there are multiple OAuth implementations, and
there's even the `:twit` app for posting tweets and reading timelines. Here's
how you get setup.

> Thanks to `~poldec-tonteg` for helping me to get going!

### Preconditions

- There are some bugs in the twitter app, lib, and a generator. Until [this PR](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/415) is merged, you'll need to manually copy in those changes.
- You may run into an outstanding bug in `%eyre` wherein the the request queue gets stuck and prints a `%pump-blocked` error. The fix is [posted here](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.4.17..04.07.40..a663~/).

### Create a Twitter app config

- Browse to [apps.twitter.com](https://apps.twitter.com/) and click "Create New App"
- Fill out the form. Be sure to include a callback url (the value doesn't matter)
- Click "Create your Twitter application"

### Configure credentials

From your urbit:

```
> |init-oauth1 /com/twitter
```

Copy and paste your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret from your Twitter app.
After you enter those, you'll see `:hood` save your credentials to `%clay`
(encrypted with your private key):

```
+ /~your-urbit/home/6/sec/com/twitter/atom
```

Now, test your config:

```
> +https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json
To authenticate twitter.com visit:
https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token={$SOME-TOKEN}
```

Browse to that URL. You'll be asked to authorize your app. Do so.

If the app authorization only requests read access, you need go back to
apps.twitter.com, select your app, click the "keys and access tokens" tab,
and click "Regenerate Consumer Key and Secret". Then you'll need to
`|init-oauth1` again, make a request, and try to authorize again.

I don't know why, but it worked for me ... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

### Start `:twit`

```
> |start %twit
>=
```

You'll see the following error, since your console tries to subscribe
automatically, but %twit doesn't have a console interface. Ignore it.

```

/~master-morzod/home/0/app/twit:<[228 23].[228 46]>
/~master-morzod/home/0/app/twit:<[228 29].[228 45]>
/~master-morzod/home/0/app/twit:<[231 3].[248 5]>
/~master-morzod/home/0/app/twit:<[232 3].[248 5]>
/~master-morzod/home/0/app/twit:<[233 5].[233 30]>
[%missed-path /sole]
/~master-morzod/home/0/app/twit:<[233 27].[233 29]>
```

You'll also see this:

```
+ /~master-morzod/home/7/web/plan
```

`:twit` automatically adds your twitter username to `%/web/plan`, which is
displayed on your urbit homepage.

### Tweet

```
> :twit|as %your-username 'your tweet'
[%twit-wake %peer /home/joemfb]
[%add-auth-header "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token"]
[%add-auth-header "https://api.twitter.com/1.1/statuses/update.json"]
~your-urbit[twit]: https://twitter.com/your-username/status/1234567891011121314
```

### Read your timeline

```
> +twit/feed %your-username
(some tweets)
```

Or read directly from the Urbit namespace:

```
> /+  twitter
> .^((list post:twitter) %gx /=twit=/home/$your-username/twit-feed)
(some tweets)
```

### Read somebody's tweets

```
> +twit/feed %some-username, =typ %user
(some tweets)
```

Or read directly from the Urbit namespace:

```
> /+  twitter
> .^((list post:twitter) %gx /=twit=/user/$your-username/twit-feed)
(some tweets)
```

Happy tweeting!
