As I noted in my "improved addition" post, my original post on multiplication in nock was deficient, in that the multiplication function wasn't written to be "call"-able in larger programs.  Another shortcoming is that it didn't make use of a separate addition function, and so was less elegant.  In this post let's correct those mistakes.

The algorithm is going to be a bit different from last time, because now we'll assume that we already have an "add" function.  (Which we do, see again "improved addition".)  The function takes a tuple of unsigned integers [N1 N2] as an argument and returns the product.  We need one variable to store the answer, x, and one variable to serve as a counter, k.

The algo in pseudo-code:

1.  Let x = 0
2. Let k = 0
3. If N2 = k then return x and terminate.
4. Else add N1 to x, add 1 to k, and Goto 3.

In short, the algo adds N1 to x N2 times.

To begin:

[8 [[GB1 GB2] [1 0]] w]

GB1 is a formula that we can turn into a multiplication gate, and GB2 is a formula that we can turn into an addition gate.  We already have GB2 (from the "improved addition" post):

[1 [1 [6 [5 [0 13] [0 14]] [0 12] [9 2 [[0 2] [[4 [0 12]] [0 13]] [[4 [0 14]] [0 15]]]]]] [1 0] [0 1]]

The initial subject is [N1 N2], but the subject for 'w' is: [[GB1* GB2*] 0] [N1 N2]

As in the last post, the * indicates that GB1* is modified from GB1 by having had the initial subject passed to it.  We still need to figure out what GB1* looks like, but for now let's think of it as:

[[1 [multiplication arm]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]

(The [[1 0] [1 0]] tuple is for the answer variable, x, and the counter variable, k, respectively.  Each will have an initial value of 0.)  The whole subject passed to w is:

[[[[1 [multiplication arm]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]] GB2*] 0] [N1 N2]

The role of 'w' will be (i) to create a multiplication gate, and (ii) to call it.  w:

[8 [9 4 [0 2]] [9 2 a]]

So, looking at [9 4 [0 2]], we take [0 2], [[[[1 [multiplication arm]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]] GB2*] 0], and pass it to [0 4] of the latter, [[1 [multiplication arm]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]].  The result of [9 4 [0 2]] is:

[[multiplication arm] [[0 0] z]], where z = [[[[1 [multiplication arm]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]] GB2*] 0].

The whole subject being passed to [9 2 a] is therefore:

[[multiplication arm] [[0 0] z]] [z [N1 N2]]

We now have a multiplication gate to call!  As noted in the last post, the kind of subject for calling a gate is, by convention:

[[gate] [[argument(s)] [context]]]

Hence, a:

[[0 4] [0 7] [0 5]]

The function passes the subject [[multiplication arm] [[N1 N2] [[0 0] z]]] to the multiplication arm itself.

We still have to figure out what GB1 is, so that we can know what the [multiplication arm] looks like. 

For starters, GB1:

[1 [[1 [8 [9 5 [0 15]] b]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]]

The only new part is [8 [9 5 [0 15]] b].  If it looks like we're creating a new gate, attaching it to our subject, and then passing the result to b, that's because we are.  But what is [0 15]?  It's z, and we're passing that to [0 5] of the latter, which just so happens to be GB2*.  We're making an addition gate.  To simplify a bit, let's think of GB2* as:

[[1 [addition arm]] [[1 0] [0 1]]]

So when we pass z to it, we get:

[[addition arm] [0 z]]

Thus, the subject that we pass to b is:

[[addition arm] [0 z]] [[multiplication arm] [[N1 N2] [[0 0] z]]]

The reason we're producing the addition gate now is that we're going to call it in the multiplication gate.  This is a normal practice.  Any time some gate P needs to call other gate Q, P will first have to create Q by pulling the relevant formula from the context and modifying it accordingly.

On to b, 'if N2=k then return x, else c':

[6 [5 [0 29] [0 61]] [0 60] c]

Address # 29 of the subject is N2, and address # 61 is the right 0 of '[0 0]'.  (Remember that the zeros of [0 0] are x and k, respectively.)

c, 'loop back (adding N1 to x, adding 1 to k)':

[9 2 [[0 6] [0 14] d]]

Here we're trying to create a new subject of the form [[gate] [[argument(s)] [context]]] to pass back to the multiplication arm.  And the gate has to be the multiplication one, which is at address # 6.  At address # 14 is [N1 N2], which leaves the context for d.  We still need to add N1 to x, and 1 to k.

d, 'add 1 to k, and keep z the same':

[[e [4 [0 61]]] [0 31]]

That just leaves...

e, 'add N1 to x':

[9 2 [[0 4] [[[0 60] [0 28]] [0 5]]]]

Here is where we call the addition function.  As always, we call addition by passing a subject of the form  [[gate] [[argument(s)] [context]]].  So we take the addition gate at address # 4, then pass [x N1] as the arguments, and [0 z] as the context.  This returns the sum, as desired.

So, the larger subject being passed to the multiplication arm, for the loop, is:

[multiplication gate] [[N1 N2] [[x+N1 k+1] z]]

That's it!  The whole of GB1 is:

[1 [[1 [8 [9 5 [0 15]] [6 [5 [0 29] [0 61]] [0 60] [9 2 [[0 6] [0 14] [[[9 2 [[0 4] [[[0 60] [0 28]] [0 5]]]] [4 [0 61]]] [0 31]]]]]]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]]

Thus, the whole multiplication function, all substitutions made, is:

[8 [[[1 [[1 [8 [9 5 [0 15]] [6 [5 [0 29] [0 61]] [0 60] [9 2 [[0 6] [0 14] [[[9 2 [[0 4] [[[0 60] [0 28]] [0 5]]]] [4 [0 61]]] [0 31]]]]]]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]] [1 [1 [6 [5 [0 13] [0 14]] [0 12] [9 2 [[0 2] [[4 [0 12]] [0 13]] [[4 [0 14]] [0 15]]]]]] [1 0] [0 1]]] [1 0]] [8 [9 4 [0 2]] [9 2 [[0 4] [0 7] [0 5]]]]]

A more readable version:

```

       [ [ [ 1
            [ 1
                [8 [9 5 [0 15]]
                   6
                      [5 [0 29] [0 61]]
                      [0 60]

                         [[0 6]

                         [0 31]]
                 ]
              ]
            ]
            [[1 0] [1 0]]
            [0 1]
          ]
          1
              [[1 6 [5 [0 13] 0 14] [0 12] 9 2 [0 2] [[4 0 12] 0 13] [4 0 14] 0 15]
              [1 0]
              [0 1]]
        ]
        [1 0]
      ]
      [8
          [9 4 [0 2]]
          [9 2 [[0 4] [0 7] [0 5]]]
      ]
    ]
```

To multiply 23 and 45 in dojo, enter:

.*([23 45] [8 [[[1 [[1 [8 [9 5 [0 15]] [6 [5 [0 29] [0 61]] [0 60] [9 2 [[0 6] [0 14] [[[9 2 [[0 4] [[[0 60] [0 28]] [0 5]]]] [4 [0 61]]] [0 31]]]]]]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]] [1 [1 [6 [5 [0 13] [0 14]] [0 12] [9 2 [[0 2] [[4 [0 12]] [0 13]] [[4 [0 14]] [0 15]]]]]] [1 0] [0 1]]] [1 0]] [8 [9 4 [0 2]] [9 2 [[0 4] [0 7] [0 5]]]]])

And you should get 1035.
