As requested on talk:

The `-F` option allows you to create a fake network on your local machine.
It does two things: forces all networking to be loopback, and lets you
start galaxies without knowing their keys.

Basic usage:

```
    % urbit -c -F -I zod -A arvo/ zod
```

The options involved:  
`-c` to create, remove this if you're starting something already created  
`-F` for fake net, always use this  
`-I zod` for galaxy zod, always use this  
`-A arvo/` for initial galaxy files, remove if already created  

If your initial galaxy files aren't the ones from the live network, you
also need to supply the bootstrapping pill with the `-B` option when you
initially create the pier. They're hosted on bootstrap.urbit.org by arvo
hash, e.g.:

```
    https://bootstrap.urbit.org/1712865c1525394333ec6bc1d408c80ad5391f5c.pill
```

Once this is up, creating its children is simple. Ticket them from the
dojo:

```
    > +ticket ~marzod
    ~sample-ticket-noteven-valid
```

and then boot them as you normally would a ship/ticket pair, but with
the `-F` option:

```
    % urbit -F -w marzod -t sample-ticket-noteven-valid
```

Remember to use `-F` whenever you start them up again:

```
    % urbit -F -I zod zod
    % urbit -F marzod
```
