Well it's extremely likely that I don't know what I am talking about and it actually tolerates partial evaluation just fine and I don't know how to use it. I was specifically imagining trying to evaluate a single ++ section of a core(?, still working on vocab) and having that not work out super well because there were unbound symbols.

Also A CLOJURE IMPLEMENTATION OHHH HELL YES! would you be willing to write up the current state of affairs on it? Does it work? SO GLORIOUS!
