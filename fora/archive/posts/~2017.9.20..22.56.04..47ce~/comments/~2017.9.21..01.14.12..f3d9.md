I was super excited to read the ETH post. Good work explaining it all, being somewhat familiar with ethereum pretty much everything is clear, I also looked at the contracts and they are straightforward so far. 
I'm a big ethereum fan from the very beginning, I sold some ETH to get some urbit stars in the last sale. Could you say something how existing stars and planets are going to be ported? Especially currently "living" ones, i.e. the ones who already have a ticket, but also the ones who just have an invite.
