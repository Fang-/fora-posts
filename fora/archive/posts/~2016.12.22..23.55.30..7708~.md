My name is ~hoclun-rigsep. I live in New York; I'm a fireman here.

So, this Urbit thing is pretty exciting, isn't it? But I write to confess a
failure of inspiration, which I have decided to attribute to a sense of
isolation from my fellow urbits. I am jealous of you on the West Coast and
believe we should form a meatspace hub here on the East Coast. 

I have calculated the best possible location for such a meetup, considering
innumerable factors in sublime combination. The result happens to be a
canteen located at 61 Bergen Street three blocks from my residence in Brooklyn.
If I knew I had to show face (and code) to other urbits even once a
month, I would dedicate myself to the project in a way that I have already
shown myself is not possible otherwise. I suspect I am not the only one who is
having this experience.

Thoughts?
