Yeah , seL4 is very cool (although it is solving a different problem -- it's a classical OS, not a deterministic OS).  But you see the same phenomenon in which a system that has a rigorous policy against growing hair converges.

I think of XML, JSON and IPv4, JSON is really the only member of this set that approaches some sort of perfection.  All of them are frozen because there's really no way to version them.  But I'm not sure -- again, except in the case of JSON -- that their developers knew they were heading for absolute zero.  They *had* to be frozen.  Using Kelvin versioning in the process of developing them would not have resulted in any magic improvement, it just would have made the process more legible, both to the developers and to their customers.  XML in particular came from the "library science" world and could really have benefited from some system software savvy.

If you think of about the set of problems for which something like a perfect answer can be reached, and the set of problems for which there is no way to revise the answer, these sets aren't necessarily overlapping.  The only part of Urbit that *has* to be frozen is Nock.  Everything else can update itself.
