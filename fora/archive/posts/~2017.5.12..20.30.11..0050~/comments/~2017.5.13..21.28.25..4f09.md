I'll be perfectly honest: I've read the Ax commentary several times over the years, and I still have no clue what the hell it means. Nock is simple (too simple, most would say) and may be lacking in some manner of intellectual purity, but it is also *obviously perfect*. Nock, or the equivalent virtual machine at the bottom of the Martian stack, must be Maxwell's Equations. It must be E=MC^2, cognito ergo sum, blindingly obvious and beautiful. Now, a other, saner programmer would obvious say Nock isn't that, but at least they can read it and understand the consequences.

There are, of course, problems with it. The loobean, as a point of contension. The sneaking in of Nock 11, the most glaring, like a blade between your ribs. But it is also godly and pure, a usable base without needing to define Black/White/Red bits and impure entropy sources and something about no programs ever terminating and permutation sets of axioms.
