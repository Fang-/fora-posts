Can reproduce. Things seem to work fine as long as both apps are running locally, and break when you put them on different ships.

Looking at the code the stack trace points to:  
[gall.hoon:486](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/maint-20160818/arvo/gall.hoon#L486)  
we see gall is doing a `+-got:by`, which crashes with `%need` when the requested key isn't found. I don't think this should be happening, and it seems gall thinks "oh, we crashed? better keep trying!", hence the irresponsiveness.

I'm not too familiar with gall, but will forward this to someone who is.
