Hi Urbitters,

I have been hosting a blog called Classic in Orbit (https://wacten.that.world/classic/) on the ~wacten star for quite some time. This is a blog about Ethereum Classic, but on the Urbit network. There's a few posts there and a series that intends to teach people how to create an Ethereum client from scratch.

Let me know how you think of it. Ideas and comments are appreciated.

P.S. I would strongly suggest Urbit not to tie itself to a single blockchain like only bootstrapping from Ethereum.  Consensus is a hard thing, and multiple source of truth might be a better option. For example, we can record Urbit's PKI infra in Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, and just let users to choose which blockchain they would like to use as the "source". Or even better, just keep Urbit pure and don't deal with the cryptocurrency mess...

Nothing against Ethereum, but hmm... it just feels a little bit wrong to host an Ethereum Classic blog on a network that is tied to Ethereum... So unfortunately if it's decided to move on with the path of this (https://github.com/urbit/constitution), then I might need to consider to move this blog to a fork of Urbit like Urbit Classic.
