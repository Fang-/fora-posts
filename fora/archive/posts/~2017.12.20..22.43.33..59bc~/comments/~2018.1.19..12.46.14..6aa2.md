## `~palfun-foslup`
There was some interesting discussion in urbit-meta yesterday that's highly relevant to this post, so I collected the logs and got to work. Some messages have been redacted for brevity or slightly reordered for clarity. You can find a full log of the conversation used [here](https://pastebin.com/9eNLSkrQ).

### Your chat app is cool, but does it use blockchain?

#### An urbit-meta chat digest

Conversation starts with ~fodwyt mentioning how Facebook's creators think and say publicly it's ripping apart the fabric of our society. A small wonder people are still interested in decentralized social networks, what with that negative reputation to subvert.  
Centralization can be useful, but isn't always optimal. It's just that we don't have better alternatives currently.

```
~fodwyt-ragful+ palfun, why do circle participants send messages to a circle-host at all? what if a
                circle was simply a list of participants?
~fodwyt-ragful+ (hosted by the circle host and subscribed to by circle members)
~fodwyt-ragful+ if the star can do it, why can't my planet?
~risruc-habteb+ what if every planet who joins the circle also hosts it ?
~risruc-habteb+ although it does seem like there need not be any distinction between hosts and
                members of circles.
~fodwyt-ragful+ message history could be in a dht
~fodwyt-ragful+ when you go to look at the history, you become a mirror for it  
...
~fodwyt-ragful+ there are some things (like deciding not to show membership, also channel
                moderation) that are sort of the provenance of centralized chat
~fodwyt-ragful+ but a non-centralized chat could not have those things
~palfun-foslup+ that's true actually, and good to keep in mind: we need to not be afraid to
                drop/radically chango tunctionality
~risruc-habteb+ users should be able to request data and receive it from anyone who has it to send.  
```

This starts to tie in very closely the proposal in the opening post. I mention we should maybe not turn Urbit into BitTorrent: The OS, since we have a neat hierarchical structure we shouldn't neglect to take advantage of.
~fodwyt rightfully points out that it isn't a strict either-or thing.

```
~fodwyt-ragful+ stars are perfect supernodes in a peer to peer system
~fodwyt-ragful+ and you also have a kind of implicit trust in your star that has no real parallel on
                current internet
~palfun-foslup+ what do you envison "stars as supernodes for p2p" looks/acts like?
~palfun-foslup+ planets making requests to stars, and stars resolving a data source?
~fodwyt-ragful+ so, something like a bittorrent tracker
~fodwyt-ragful+ i want this piece of urbit-meta's history, i ask my star to tell me about peers who
                can give me that info
~fodwyt-ragful+ so the star hosts a kind of index
~fodwyt-ragful+ which is i think what you said :)
~risruc-habteb+ if messages are packaged with [hash timestamp content] then users would only need to
                download the hashes from the star and could fill in other bits from peerss.
~fodwyt-ragful+ a key asset of urbit is that everything can be cryptographically signed, so i can
                trust the channel history i get from a random stranger, if he has it and is willing
                to give it to me (a status he communicates to his star)
~fodwyt-ragful+ and maybe even with a merkel-style hash of the channel history, for verification
                that nothing has been redacted
```

We quickly agreed that it's probably a good idea to support both (hall's current) centralized and (the proposed) decentralized models of messaging. Perhaps support the latter as a separate application entirely.  
Yet, decentralized chat is still chat, and it might still want to support things like content rules and invites/bans. 

```
~risruc-habteb+ you'd have to have a system of checking channel rules, resolving any conflicts and
                then signing before sending.
~palfun-foslup+ but then who decides the rules? who decides invites/bans
~fodwyt-ragful+ invites/bans would be message types and more advisory than what you would call rules
~fodwyt-ragful+ i.e. an invite is "hey, if ~palfun-foslup shows up, i say he's cool" (in a noun
                format)
~fodwyt-ragful+ and a ban is "~palfun-foslup says you should ignore everything ~sorreg-namtyv has to
                say in /urbit-pol."
~palfun-foslup+ hmm i guess there are ways to work admin powers into a bt model, yeah
~fodwyt-ragful+ but some people (me) might be atrracted to this kind of chat, where server load is
                not meaningful as a concept
~palfun-foslup+ though it's starting to sound a little bit like a blockchain too lol
~fodwyt-ragful+ well, what is a chat history if not a ledger
```

At this point a Google tech talk from 2006 gets mentioned for the second time. [A new way to look at networking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCZMoY3q2uM). ~risruc shares a timestamped [link](https://youtu.be/oCZMoY3q2uM?t=2562) that puts you right into the meat of it. An interesting talk, and very relevant to this conversation.

A little while later, ~rovnys joins to continue discussion on the blockchain chat idea. This gets pretty dense with interesting details.  
It starts off with a focus on message ordering and how that would be determined in a chat ledger.

```
~rovnys-ricfer+ ~fodwyt the merkle hash on talk messages is an interesting idea, but i think it
                limits performance in this case
~rovnys-ricfer+ we don't need a strict ordering of talk messages
~rovnys-ricfer+ and if we had a strict ordering, then i think that would impede the ability for them
                to be disseminated among nodes
~palfun-foslup+ yeah we'd probably only need strict ordering for events like configuration changes?
                ie invites/bans
~fodwyt-ragful+ how would the strict ordering impede dissemination? you don't need to wait for the
                "sealing in" to the blockchain to get the message, just for it to be recorded as
                "the history of the channel"
~rovnys-ricfer+ i guess i was thinking that the person sending the message wouldn't be able to send
                the merkle hash that includes the previous messages until they know what the
                "correct" previous message was
~rovnys-ricfer+ so you're saying you could send the message itself,
~rovnys-ricfer+ and then the hash that verifies it would be sent later after the canonical message
                ordering is settled?
~fodwyt-ragful+ i'm not sure i was saying that, but that sounds reasonable
~fodwyt-ragful+ i am thinking by analogy with bitcoin transactions
~fodwyt-ragful+ you broadcast a message saying "1hf98sdf sent .042 to 1hdsf79s7", and eventually
                that gets recorded in the block ledger (confirmation). as it gets deeper into the
                chain, it gets harder to revert.
~fodwyt-ragful+ but everyone in the network sees the initial broadcast really fast
~fodwyt-ragful+ it's just an "unconfirmed transaction"
~fodwyt-ragful+ a shared channel history is pretty much a public ledger of the same sort
~fodwyt-ragful+ the strict ordering is only needed for the ledger
~rovnys-ricfer+ huh, so how do the hashes work for that message?
~rovnys-ricfer+ because the hash depends on the previous messages, right?
~fodwyt-ragful+ i suppose that would be computed when the block is generated, and not as part of the
                broadcast
~rovnys-ricfer+ right ok
~rovnys-ricfer+ so the steps of 1) send message and 2) establish canonical message order need to
                happen separately for minimum latency
~fodwyt-ragful+ "need to" probably depends on the use case
~rovnys-ricfer+ so ... let's say a message comes in from a slow star, which says it's a hundred
                messages behind
~rovnys-ricfer+ how do we decide whether or not to redo all of the later hashes?
~fodwyt-ragful+ i think you can't redo hashes once they're in a block (assuming the blockchain
                metaphor)
~fodwyt-ragful+ so the farthest back you can claim to have said something is probably the last block
                that was processed
~fodwyt-ragful+ but, maybe there is some other way to say "i said this at 8:53, it just didn't get
                into the ledger until 9:42"
...
~master~morzod+ anybody know how typical systems order messages?
~fodwyt-ragful+ just put a timestamp on when you sent it and shrug
~rovnys-ricfer+ message order is one of the n hard problems in distributed systems
~rovnys-ricfer+ note that messages in different apps will generally have different requirements
~master~morzod+ yeah, it's kind of important that there be consensus
~rovnys-ricfer+ it's not the end of the world if talk messages show up out of order
~rovnys-ricfer+ but that's not true for, say, money
~master~morzod+ but that's expensive and complicated with peers
~master~morzod+ another reason that hosted circles are easier
~fodwyt-ragful+ it's not the end of the world, but neither is it ideal
~fodwyt-ragful+ having a single source of authority is like not solving the problem
~fodwyt-ragful+ i think the right answers to this are probably: 1) we need message ordering,
                distributed chat is stupid, 2) we don't really need message ordering, timestamps are
                good enough, kind of how we don't need bans and invites.
~fodwyt-ragful+ of course, it's also not necessarily an either-or, like full decentralized crypto
                verified everthing vs. send all messages through a server
~fodwyt-ragful+ stars (or some other entities) can have queen-of-clean benevolent dictator status
                "the only timeline of this chat that matters is what ~samzod saw"

```

Redacted there is a section where they briefly talked about history verification, and how in Urbit we could theoretically defer to stars or galaxies to resolve disputes. Stars could notorize the blocks. It's also agreed that any solution in this space can and should be generic, because of its uses in other apps, and hall's goal to be an extensible, general purpose communication bus.  
Discussion then winds down with proposed end-games and links to relevant literature.

```
~rovnys-ricfer+ i think talk messages are a crdt
~rovnys-ricfer/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type
~rovnys-ricfer+ (or can be considered such)
~rovnys-ricfer+ i feel like we should have federation solutions for a few kinds of replicated data
                types
~rovnys-ricfer+ ~fodwyt i like that version of letting each talk channel (or some equivalent for
                other apps) pick a node that can be the queen-of-clean
~fodwyt-ragful+ also, people could vote on candidate timelines
~fodwyt-ragful+ (in a mostly-automated fashion, one would hope)
~fodwyt-ragful+ ~samzod says, does everyone agree that the chat history from 8:00 to 8:10 has this
                hash? all in favor say aye?
~master~morzod+ i think full p2p asymmetric crypto group message would be very cool
~master~morzod+ i also think it's massive overkill for 90+% of conversations
~fodwyt-ragful+ although, i think not having messages flow through central authorities is also
                important for scaling reasons
~master~morzod+ hash conflict notification could be an interesting in-between
~fodwyt-ragful+ i saw a "build your own blockchain" post somewhere recently...
