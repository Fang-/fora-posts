## `~wisdyr-holpeg`
Even I would much prefer to identify people by their 'real' names.  After the renaming I have no idea who anyone is anymore.  I think Curtis has just been down in the `ames` and `jael` hole for a while, and he's not quite seeing the problem.  (We just argued about some of this in person — but I'll get my point of view on the record, and we'll advance the discussion in writing here).

As I see it, the process is about as simple as you imagine.  Everyone has a file, similar to `web.plan` — but more complete / fully featured.  Some daemon needs to both subscribe to updates on these files and keep a local version.  I should be able to override any of the fields that someone else provides locally, while still getting updates to their `.plan`.  For example: maybe I want to call 'Curtis Yarvin' 'Curdle', like I would in a phone book.

The basic functionality here is provided by `%clay` and `%ames`, but something needs to actually keep track of the list.  Marks should be able to provide the diff logic.  Then other apps (like `talk`) can use the data in this daemon to pull names or whatever other information.

Whether or not this is a vane is up in the air — but I do think there's something here that can't be covered by a string in the certificate.
