This program takes N as an input, and then returns '0' if it's prime, '1' otherwise.

For the algo, we'll assume that we have a multiply function ('mult(i, j)') and a 'greater than' function ('>').  (We do!  See previous posts.)  We also need two variables, i and j.

+ Let i = 2
+ Let j = 2
+ If N = 0 then return 1 and terminate
+ If N = 1 then return 1 and terminate
+ If N = 2 then return 0 and terminate
+ If N = 3 then return 0 and terminate
+ If mult(i, j) = N then return 1 and terminate
+ If j+1 = N then
+ If mult(i, j) > N then return 0, else add 1 to i and goto 7
+ If mult(i, j) > N then let i = 2, add 1 to j, and goto 7
+ Add 1 to i and goto 7

For input values 0 through 3, the program says whether it's prime without any calculation (lines 3-6).

When I wrote the first version of the prime checker, the program, for any given input N, would work out all the products of any two numbers i and j greater than 1 and less than N.  Each time it produced a product P, it tested whether P=N.  If so, N isn't prime.  If no product = N, N is prime.  Obviously this is a horrendously inefficient algorithm.  It was so slow in dojo that I was embarrassed to post it.

The algorithm above is better, because, for some j, where 1 < j < N, when it finds some number i such that mult(i, j) is greater than N, it doesn't test any higher numbers.  It adds 1 to j and resets i to 2.  That cuts out many unnecessary computations.

That said, the result is still quite slow and inefficient.  I'm sure there are many easy ways to narrow the scope of numbers to be multiplied together.  But that isn't the point---we want to learn nock programming.  We aren't going to use this function in serious applications.  Hoon + jets work just fine for serious tasks.  So, on to the nock!

Here is the structure of the program:

```
[8 [produce library core] [8 [produce prime checker core] [call PC core]]]
```

For our library, we need 'greater than', multiplication, and addition.  (The last isn't explicitly called in what we'll be writing today, but it is called by the multiplication gate, so we need it in the library.)  These are all available in other posts.

To begin:

```
[8 [[[[r s] GB5] GB6] [1 0]] w]
```

GB5 is the multiplication formula, and GB6 is the addition formula.  's' is the 'greater than' pair of formulas.  The 'greater than' function has two arms in the battery---the first of which runs once, and the second of which is a loop.  

s (greater than):

```
[1 [[CB3 CB4] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]]
```

The tuple, `[[1 0] [1 0]]`, is for the two counters used in the 'greater than' function.

Notice that in the pseudo-code program above, we have two parts: one which runs once, and another which loops.  So we'll again use a formula which creates a core with two arms in the battery, an arm for each part.

r (prime checker):

```
[1 [[CB1 CB2] [[[1 2] [1 2]] [0 1]]]]
```

The tuple `[[1 2] [1 2]]` is for i and j, whose initial values are each '2'.

You might be wondering about the ordering in the library-production function, `[[[r s] GB5] GB6] [1 0]`.  "Does the order of the formulas in that part really matter?"  It does matter.  "Why?"  The short answer is that some of the functions we're going to call---well, just multiplication, actually---expect other functions to be in a particular place.  If we foil that expectation they won't work correctly.  I'll say more about this later.

The initial subject is just N, so the subject being passed to w is:

```
[[[[[CB1 CB2] [[[1 2] [1 2]] [0 1]]] [[CB3 CB4] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]] GB5* ] GB6* ] N
```

(No one said it would be easy.)  The head of this cell is our library.

'w' has two jobs: (i) to create the prime checker (PC) core, and (ii) to run that core.

w:

```
[8 [9 16 [0 2]] a]
```

To produce the PC core, we pass the library as a subject to the formula at address # 16 of the library, which is:

```
[[CB1 CB2] [[[1 2] [1 2]] [0 1]]]
```

The result is of [9 16 [0 2]] is (fudging a bit because we don't yet know what CB1 or CB2 look like):  

`[[[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]] [[2 2] z]]`, where z is the library.

```
z = [[[[[CB1 CB2] [[[1 2] [1 2]] [0 1]]] [[CB3 CB4] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]] GB5* ] GB6* ]
```

So the whole subject being passed to a is:

```
[[[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]] [[2 2] z]] [z N]
```

All 'a' must do is call the first PC arm, passing it a subject it knows how to handle.  The subject, by convention, must be of the form:

`[[battery] [[argument(s)] [context]]]`

Hence, a:

`[9 4 [[0 4] [0 7] [0 5]]]`

The new subject passed will fit that form:

battery: `[0 4] => [[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]]`

argument: `[0 7] => N`

context: `[0 5] => [[2 2] z]`

The whole subject is, therefore:

`[[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]] [N [[2 2] z]]`

This is passed to the formula at address # 4, which is [PC Arm 1].

It's time to put [PC Arm 1] together---or rather, its ancestor, CB1.

CB1:

```
[1 [8 [9 9 [0 15]] [8 [9 17 [0 31]] b]]]
```

Ignoring the '1' function, which is removed when [PC Arm 1] is called, this formula modifies the subject twice and passes the result to b.  Each modification prepares a new core to be called later in the program.

The first modification takes the library (at address # 15) and prepares the multiplication gate: '[Multiplication Arm] [[0 0] z]'.  We need this available because we'll be making lots of multiplication calls later in the program.  So the subject is now:

[[Multiplication Arm] [[0 0] z]] [[[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]] [N [[2 2] z]]]

The second modification takes the library (now at location #31) and activates the 'greater than' (GT) core: '[[GT Arm 1] [GT Arm 2]] [[0 0] z]]'.  Thus, the subject being passed to b is:

```
[[[GT Arm 1] [GT Arm 2]] [[0 0] z]]]  [[[Mult. Arm] [[0 0] z]] [[[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]] [N [[2 2] z]]]]
```

(Again, no one said this would be easy.)

The role of 'b' is to carry out the parts of the algorithm that only happen once.  For the following, keep in mind that N is at address # 30.

b, 'if N = 0 then return 1, else c': 

```
[6 [5 [0 30] [1 0]] [1 1] c]
```

c, 'if N = 1 then return 1, else d':

```
[6 [5 [0 30] [1 1]] [1 1] d]
```

d, 'if N = 2 then return 0, else e':

```
[6 [5 [0 30] [1 2]] [1 0] e]
```

e, 'if N = 3 then return 0, else f':

```
[6 [5 [0 30] [1 3]] [1 0] f]
```

f, 'call the loop arm':

```
[9 29 [0 1]]
```

The loop arm, `[PC Arm 2]`, is at address # 29.  We pass the whole subject.

Why did we create the GT and multiplication cores in the first arm rather than the loop arm?  After all, we don't call them in this arm.

Well, why shouldn't we?  The less that happens in the loop arm, the faster the loop can run.  There's no need to remake the same cores over and over again.

On to CB2 (and ignoring the 1 function), 'if mult(i, j) = N then return 1, else h':

```
[1 [6 [5 g [0 30]] [1 1] h]]
```

But what does g look like?  We need to call the multiplication gate.  And we need to pass it a subject it knows how to handle, so of the form:

[[arm] [[argument(s)] [context]]]

g, 'mult(i, j)':

[9 2 [[0 12] [[0 62] [0 13]]]]

arm: [0 12] => [Mult. Arm]

arguments: [0 62] => [i j]    :: this is initially [2 2], because i and j are each 2

context: [0 13] => [[0 0] z]    :: the [0 0] part is for the variables the multiplication arm needs

When [Mult. Arm] [[i j] [[0 0] z]] is passed to [Mult. Arm], the result is the product of i and j, which is what we're after here.

NOTE:  [Mult. Arm] does its own core creating and calling.  It uses the addition core.  If we're not careful with how we put together the library, z, we can screw things up by making it impossible for the multiplication function to find the addition function.  To better understand this, see GB5 (multiplication):

```
[1 [[1 [8 [9 5 [0 15]] [6 [5 [0 29] [0 61]] [0 60] [9 2 [[0 6] [0 14] [[[9 2 [[0 4] [[[0 60] [0 28]] [0 5]]]] [4 [0 61]]] [0 31]]]]]]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]]
```

Okay, that's a lot.  The part we care about is: '[9 5 [0 15]]'.  This is the part where the multiplication arm creates the addition gate.  It's looking for the library at address #15, which is fine, because the subject we're sending it fulfills that requirement:

```
[Mult. Arm] [[i j] [[0 0] z]]
```

But once it has the library, it's going to look for addition in address # 5.  When I first wrote the multiplication function, I had no idea about how I'd eventually use it, but we want to make sure that we always can without having to go back and rewrite it later.

Let's take one last look at how we produced our library: [[[r s] GB5] GB6] [1 0]

Notice that I can always add more functions to the left, without disturbing the location of the addition formula, GB6.  It's at 5, and I can make sure it always stays there.  I just have to make sure that all future functions go left.  As long as we're careful we can always make this work.

Okay, that's enough!  Back to the unfinished CB2:

```
[1 [6 [5 g [0 30]] [1 1] h]]
```

We have g already.

h, 'if j+1 = N then k, else t':

[6 [5 [4 [0 125]] [0 30]] k t]

j is at address # 125 of our massive subject:

```
[[[GT Arm 1] [GT Arm 2]] [[0 0] z]]]  [[[Mult. Arm] [[0 0] z]] [[[PC Arm 1] [PC Arm 2]] [N [[i j] z]]]]
```

k, 'if mult(i, j) > N then return 0, else m':

[6 p [1 0] m]

p, 'mult(i, j) > N':

```
[9 4 [[0 4] [[g [0 30]] [0 5]]]]
```

Here we call the 'greater than' (GT) function.  We need to pass it a subject it understands, so of the form:

`[[battery] [[argument(s)] [context]]]`

battery: [0 4] => [GT Arm 1] [GT Arm 2]

arguments: `[g [0 30]] => [g N]`   :: remember that g is mult(i, j), and that we can reuse the code we already wrote for g

context: `[0 5] => [[0 0] z]`

So the whole subject passed to the first GT battery is:

```
[[GT Arm 1] [GT Arm 2]]  [[g N] [[0 0] z]]
```

The result will be 0 or 1, depending on whether mult(i, j) > N, of course.

m, 'add 1 to i and loop':

```
[9 29 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[0 14] [[0 30] [[[4 [0 124]] [0 125]] [0 63]]]]]]]
```

This is where our massive subject is a little painful to work with.  We pass the whole thing back to PC arm 2 (the loop arm), but we increment i by 1 at address # 124.

t, 'if mult(i, j) > N then q, else m':

```
[6 p q m]
```

We already have p and m above, so we can reuse what we wrote there.

q, 'let i = 2, add 1 to j, and loop':

```
[9 29 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[0 14] [[0 30] [[[1 2] [4 [0 125]]] [0 63]]]]]]]
```

We pass the whole subject back to the loop arm, but with the noted modifications to i and j.

.*(83 [8 [[[[[1 [[[1 [8 [9 9 [0 15]] [8 [9 17 [0 31]] [6 [5 [0 30] [1 0]] [1 1] [6 [5 [0 30] [1 1]] [1 1] [6 [5 [0 30] [1 2]] [1 0] [6 [5 [0 30] [1 3]] [1 0] [9 29 [0 1]]]]]]]]] [1 [6 [5 [9 2 [[0 12] [[0 62] [0 13]]]] [0 30]] [1 1] [6 [5 [4 [0 125]] [0 30]] [6 [9 4 [[0 4] [[[9 2 [[0 12] [[0 62] [0 13]]]] [0 30]] [0 5]]]] [1 0] [9 29 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[0 14] [[0 30] [[[4 [0 124]] [0 125]] [0 63]]]]]]]] [6 [9 4 [[0 4] [[[9 2 [[0 12] [[0 62] [0 13]]]] [0 30]] [0 5]]]] [9 29 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[0 14] [[0 30] [[[1 2] [4 [0 125]]] [0 63]]]]]]] [9 29 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[0 14] [[0 30] [[[4 [0 124]] [0 125]] [0 63]]]]]]]]]]]] [[[1 2] [1 2]] [0 1]]]] [1 [[[1 [6 [5 [0 14] [0 15]] [1 1] [9 5 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[0 6] [0 15]]]]]]] [1 [6 [5 [4 [0 28]] [0 13]] [1 1] [6 [5 [4 [0 29]] [0 12]] [1 0] [9 5 [[0 2] [[0 6] [[[4 [0 28]] [4 [0 29]]] [0 15]]]]]]]]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]]] [1 [[1 [8 [9 5 [0 15]] [6 [5 [0 29] [0 61]] [0 60] [9 2 [[0 6] [0 14] [[[9 2 [[0 4] [[[0 60] [0 28]] [0 5]]]] [4 [0 61]]] [0 31]]]]]]] [[[1 0] [1 0]] [0 1]]]]] [1 [1 [6 [5 [0 13] [0 14]] [0 12] [9 2 [[0 2] [[4 [0 12]] [0 13]] [[4 [0 14]] [0 15]]]]]] [1 0] [0 1]]] [1 0]] [8 [9 16 [0 2]] [9 4 [[0 4] [0 7] [0 5]]]]])
```

The result is 0, for 'yes'.

Be warned, if you copy and paste that it, the parser will take a while to spit it all out.  And, as I said at the beginning, the algorithm is very inefficient.  If you want a quick answer, stick to 3 digit inputs.  4 digits is normally okay, but if you hit on a prime in the upper 4 digits you may want to go make a sandwich or something.

Enjoy!
