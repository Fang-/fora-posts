Sometimes one must compromise aesthetics to achieve results. I seem to recall jets being a controversial idea at one time. ETH bootstrap is like jetting to solidity rather than C. It is ugly. Many of us who appreciate Urbit for aesthetic reasons have a deeply held, borderline irrational disgust for ETH. Like on an emotional level. Urbit is supposed to replace the corrupt web stack, from the ground up. If we incorporate ETH into the Urbit metaverse, we are perpetuating and even adding to the tower of crap. But, Hezbollah also appeared much more elegant before they had to administer territory. 

We have mostly skirted the point that creating an EC20 token is going to make us all rich. Or at least, create a more liquid market where people can speculate on the value of Urbit real estate. We are supposed to build trust, so why not start with a ripple-like consenus for planet IOU's (but definitely not actually Ripple or Stellar ledger). That strikes me as a more urbit-like way to bootstrap a currency. 

Newborn urbits would be issued directly in redemption of corresponding IOU's. We could use an entirely separate system of signed receipts for secondary transfer records. We are not so concerned about double-spend of physical planets as opposed to the paper IOU's.
