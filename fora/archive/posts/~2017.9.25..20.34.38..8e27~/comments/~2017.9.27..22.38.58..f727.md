> What I am concerned with is a bug in the contract being exploited which transfers control of my Urbit identity from the ECDSA key I control to some anonymous ETH address. In that case what recourse do I have to prove that I am still the owner of my ship?

One, this is a very shallow and simple contract compared to many Ethereum things.  Two, we're going to give it a professional audit and I hope quite a few amateur ones.

Three, as we've already expressed, Urbit is self-governing and we're not afraid to hardfork in the case of any such bug (which presumably wouldn't affect just you).  This is quite different from Ethereum hard-forking itself ex post facto.
