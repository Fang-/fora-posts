~tonlur-sarret cleared it up in urbit-meta:

```
    ~tonlur-sarret+ because of the way the type system works, the list could be
    ~tonlur-sarret+ null, so it can't find the i face on null.
    ~tonlur-sarret+ so you need to use ?~ to check if the list is null.
    ~taglux-nidsep+ oh dear, you told me that once before
    ~taglux-nidsep+ hah, thanks for the reminder

    ~taglux-nidsep+ this answers so many question about why i was having trouble
    ~taglux-nidsep+ with my program yesterday
    ~tonlur-sarret# =+(a=`(list @)`~[4 2] i.a)__find-fork-d -find.i.a /~tonlur-sar
    ~tonlur-sarret# =+(a=`(list @)`~[4 2] ?~(a ~ i.a))  4
