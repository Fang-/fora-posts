Hey, I used the ask function, and got a planet, which was cool.

~marsur-savweg is a pretty cool name, I think.  Only, there was a problem with my urbit, where it threw an error whenever I tried to start it with the bash command bin/urbit <dope-planet>.  So i tried rebuilding and reinstalling it from the tarball.

Now it runs, but when I start it up with the planet name marsur-savweg, I end up with a different name (~narlet_sommev(Didn't even realize you could have an underscore in there.)) and nothing seems to work.  I can't join any chats, it throws a trace of some kind and a %reap-friend-fail message whenever I try to join the urbit meta.

the error message specifically looks like this:

-------------| ;join /urbit-meta
--------------| has glyph '='
--------------| porch: hey '=' /urbit-meta

I'm not really sure what to do here, if anyone could help me find my way back to my planet it would be a big help.

Thanks!
