## `~hidret-matped`
Say, when I run the click app, I get the following response after hitting the Poke button:
```
"click"
ford: cast %examples-click-clique
ford: casting %json to %examples-click-clique
fame: no /~hidret-matped/sandbox/59/mar/examples-click-clique
```
Are we missing a file in /mar/examples/click?
