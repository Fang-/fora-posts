## `~mastyr-harlud`
Sorry the above post hasn't rendered the way I intended. Let's try again.

I successfully compiled urbit from the master branch today, but I had to install an additional package in Ubuntu before the `make` command ran successfully. Before installing `libuv1-dev`, I received the following error after running make from the root urbit folder:

```
 #include <uv.h>
                ^
compilation terminated.
```

verything ran smoothly after installing `libuv1-dev`. Not sure if anyone has experienced this error before, but thought I'd mention it here. Note also that my computer *did* have the regular, automatic `libuv1` package installed prior to receiving the error.
