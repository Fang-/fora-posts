You want a nock function that takes an ordered pair (e.g. [23 45]) and returns the product (1,035).

Here's how it all works. (Thanks to ~tonret-sigsur for suggesting a better algorithm than the one I first had in mind.)  We have N1 and N2 as the inputs, and we'll use the variables j and k as counters, and x as the final answer (in noob-speak):


let j = 0, k = 0, and x = 0

:bigger loop 

If N2 = k then return x

else add to 1 to k and go to :smaller loop

:smaller loop

If N1 = j then let j = 0 and go to :bigger loop

else add 1 to x, add 1 to j, and go to :smaller loop


The idea is that we add 1 to x N1 times---and we repeat that adding process N2 times.

Initially, the subject of our nock program is the ordered pair to be multiplied. Let's "initialize" our three variables [x [j k]] by putting some zeros in front of the input:

[8 [[1 0] [[1 0] [1 0]]] a]

Now the subject should be [[[1 0] [[1 0] [1 0]]] [N1 N2]] for a.

We attach a battery, which will consist of two formulas---the two loops mentioned above.  Then we can activate the first arm:

a: [8 [1 d e] [9 4 [0 1]]]

When d (address #: 4) is activated the subject will be a core, [[d e] [[[1 0] [[1 0] [1 0]]] [N1 N2]]].

For the first loop, d, we want a conditional which is true when N2 (address #: 15) equals k (address #: 27), and otherwise false:

d:  [6 [5 [0 15] [0 27]] [0 12] [9 5 p1]]

When N2 equals k we’ll have the final answer, and so it returns x at tree address 12.  Otherwise we need to run the “smaller loop” by activating the other arm, e (address #: 5).  We want to modify the payload by adding 1 to k in p1 and leaving everything else the same:

p1:  [[0 2] [[[0 12] [[0 26] [4 [0 27]]]] [0 7]]]

Loop e is also a conditional, true when N1 (address #: 14) equals j (address #: 26), and false otherwise:

e:  [6 [5 [0 14] [0 26]] [9 4 p2] [9 5 p3]]

If true, we activate d again, modifying the payload by letting j = 0, but keeping everything else the same:

p2:  [[0 2] [[[0 12] [[1 0] [0 27]]] [0 7]]]

If false, then we stay in the smaller loop by activating e.  We’ll modify the payload by adding 1 to each of x and j, and otherwise keep the subject (the core) the same:

p3:  [[0 2] [[[4 [0 12]] [[4 [0 26]] [0 27]]] [0 7]]]

Finally, let’s substitute for a, d, e, p1, p2, and p3 to get the whole thing:

[8 [[1 0] [[1 0] [1 0]]] [8 [1 [6 [5 [0 15] [0 27]] [0 12] [9 5 [[0 2] [[[0 12] [[0 26] [4 [0 27]]]] [0 7]]]]] [6 [5 [0 14] [0 26]] [9 4 [[0 2] [[[0 12] [[1 0] [0 27]]] [0 7]]]] [9 5 [[0 2] [[[4 [0 12]] [[4 [0 26]] [0 27]]] [0 7]]]]]] [9 4 [0 1]]]]

To run in dojo:

.*([23 45] [8 [[1 0] [[1 0] [1 0]]] [8 [1 [6 [5 [0 15] [0 27]] [0 12] [9 5 [[0 2] [[[0 12] [[0 26] [4 [0 27]]]] [0 7]]]]] [6 [5 [0 14] [0 26]] [9 4 [[0 2] [[[0 12] [[1 0] [0 27]]] [0 7]]]] [9 5 [[0 2] [[[4 [0 12]] [[4 [0 26]] [0 27]]] [0 7]]]]]] [9 4 [0 1]]]])

You will get “1.035” in return.  (Martian numbers use periods, not commas.)

Hurrah!
