Super interesting.  In general, I want to see desks as the unit of installation, and (while we're still reliant on GH) I want to see a 1:1 mirror between ship/desk and GH branch.  

The copy-over-files workflow is just wrong.  The right workflow is for the sync directory and the GH working directory to be identical.  But this demands both some serious thinking about %clay, and some serious thinking about how to make it interoperate with GH.

Using a package manifest is basically the right solution if you assume that the toolchain is otherwise fixed.  But the toolchain is otherwise broken.  It is of course not inappropriate to create bandaids.

But my feeling is that it should be possible to make this system work without a manifest, which is essentially paralleling information that should exist in the filesystem tree.  If it's in the desk it's in the package.  If your desk depends on another desk, it should have that other desk in its revision-control ancestry.  Agree/disagree?
