~barpub : Your comment ""In Urbit, there is no distinction between a directory and a file" made me think of something that has bothering me for a while. Because it seems to my naive eyes that there _is_ indeed a distinction and that is that directories don't have marks. This inconsistency seems to me to be a big problem in the current %clay. 

To demonstrate, how does %clay know whether /home/web/md is a file named web with mark 'md' in the home dir or a directory 'md' in the directory 'web'. 

It seems to me that the only way to avoid the confusion is to have every entity in %clay should have the token after the final / be the mark and create a mark for directories. So, in my example above, the first would indeed be a file named web with mark 'md' in the 'home' dir and the second example would now be /home/web/md/dir (assuming 'dir' as the mark for directory).

I could, of course, be way off base on this as I am pretty new to urbit.

Sorry for comet posting, this is (the currently uninhabitable) ~winter-paches. ;)
