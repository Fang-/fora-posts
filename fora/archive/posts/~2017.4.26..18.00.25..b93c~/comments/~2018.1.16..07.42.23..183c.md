Re bubbling effect, it is another Big Social myth, we should not worry about it at all. 
There is no reason to prevent it, and more so it is unavoidable. 
People will use their Urbits as they want, and most of them will stay bubbled.
There hasn't been any society in which people were forced to socialize with people with 
whom they fundamentally disagree.

The proper channels of dissent were always books, universities and other similar venues for people capable of disagreeing with each other without violence. 

"Muh social bubble" is another utopian idea which sprang into existence as a reaction to Big Social and Big Search socially engineering search results to satiate their advertising needs. This problem is absent from Urbit world.
 
The idea that "we should engineer people to interact daily with people with whom they don't 
wont to socialize" is of the Borgs, not of Urbits ;-)

The proper civilized avenue for going outside one's own bubble is to read journals, books and newspapers from outside of bubble, and Urbit perfectly fulfills this need.
