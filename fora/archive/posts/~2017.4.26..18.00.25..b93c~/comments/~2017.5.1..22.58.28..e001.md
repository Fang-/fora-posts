This explains why [social] networks are fun in the beginning and then get worse as time goes on.

Perhaps we can leverage the fact that humans biggest resource is ultimately time and base station/group/channel/circle subscription by a derivative of time.

Some thoughts:
* Only stations inwhich you're "active" get attention, inactive ones eventually fall off your radar.
* Conversely, raise the mental cost of joining a station such that an average human can only join a small finite number before becoming overloaded.
* Demand a time commitment to stay joined to a station.  Filter/manage them all in small ways.

Those are the only ones that don't feel like they have artificial or arbitrary constraints which I think would be obvious but still here are some that do:

* Social upvoting gets you credit for staying joined to a station.  (i.e. jerks are voted off the island.)
