`~sorreg-namtyv` asked me to move [this](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/410) discussion here, so:

I've been working on [PLEAC](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/)-style Hoon snippets, at the moment dealing with "string" (i.e. tape) manipulation.  As you all know, tapes are just `(list char)`, which means I can use all the list functions for them, which is great.  Still, I've noticed that compared to other languages, certain tape functions are a bit cumbersome.  My thinking was that some additional list features for Hoon might be nice; for example, something like find and replace, or whatever.

I'm informed that the current state of the container portion of Hoon is old, and hence that the quality of the code there leaves something to be desired.  So apparently there is a lot of work to be done there anyway.  Let's have a discussion here about how we want to move forward with Hoon containers.  Doubtlessly some Martians out there have been thinking about this and have some ideas to share.
