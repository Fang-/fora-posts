To do "the List Monad" in Hoon, you'd need the following gates:

```
++  sole
  |*  a/*
  ^-  (list _a)
  ~[a]
::
++  logo
  |*  {a/(list) b/$-(* (list))}
  ^-  b
  (zing (turn a b))
```

You can use `++logo` as a ;~ composer if you want, or you can use it as above to bind names and have a comprehension:

```
%+  logo  (gulf 1 3)  |=  a/@
%+  logo  (gulf 1 3)  |=  b/@
(sole (mul a b))
```

which produces `~[1 2 3 2 4 6 3 6 9]`. For the fancy comprehension behavior of guarding, you need the black magic of:

```
++  guard
  |*  a/?
  ^-  (list)
  ?-  a
    $&  ~[~]
    $|  ~
  ==
```

With that, you can add a line like `%+  logo  (guard =((mod a 2) 0))  |=  unused/*` to the end of the above, and you'll skip `a` equalling 1 and 3 and get `~[2 4 6]`. The original example:

```
%+  logo  (gulf 1 20)  |=  a/@
%+  logo  (gulf 1 20)  |=  b/@
%+  logo  (gulf 1 20)  |=  c/@
%+  logo  (guard =((add (mul a a) (mul b b)) (mul c c)))  |=  unused/*
(sole [a=a b=b c=c])
```

Producing:

```
~[
  [a=3 b=4 c=5]
  [a=4 b=3 c=5]
  [a=5 b=12 c=13]
  [a=6 b=8 c=10]
  [a=8 b=6 c=10]
  [a=8 b=15 c=17]
  [a=9 b=12 c=15]
  [a=12 b=5 c=13]
  [a=12 b=9 c=15]
  [a=12 b=16 c=20]
  [a=15 b=8 c=17]
  [a=16 b=12 c=20]
]
```
