## `~fyr`
Unless you want a wet `|*  a/*` version(which may not play nicely with lists), you'd still want the types:

```hoon
;>  logo
  a/@  (gulf 1 20)
  b/@  (gulf 1 20)
  c/@  (gulf 1 20)
  $~  (guard =((add (mul a a) (mul b b)) (mul c c)))
  (sole [a=a b=b c=c])
==
```

Which is arguably clearer anyway, and also takes care of the "unused ~" problem.
