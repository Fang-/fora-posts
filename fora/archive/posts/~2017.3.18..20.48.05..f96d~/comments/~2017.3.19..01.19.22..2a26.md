A Nock interpreter doesn't have to reduce `*[a 8 b c]` this way.  There are various equivalent ways of carrying out the reduction.  If you look at `~digser`'s [Nock interpreter written in js](https://urbit.org/~~/docs/community-projects/nock-implementations/javascript/), you'll see that it runs `*[a 8 b c]` as `*[[*[a b] a] c]`, at least as one of the options:

```
    /**
     * extend (8): evaluate the second formula against [product of first, subject]
     *
     *   *[a 8 b c]  *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
     */
    function macroExtend (s, f) {
      return nock(s, [7, [[[7, [[0, 1], f[0]]], [0, 1]], f[1]]])
    }
  
    function extend (s, f) {
      // alternate form:
      // return nock([compose(s, [[0, 1], f[0]]), s], f[1])
      return nock([nock(s, f[0]), s], f[1])
    }
```

In fact, an interpreter could implement Nock 8 as any one of the lines in the above reduction: they're all equivalent!

For pedagogical reasons, I probably should have stuck to reducing the outermost function for each step.  In practice, however, the order shouldn't matter.
