So, my planet was quietly running away over the weekend when the console started emitting messages like this:

bail: meme

It eventually emitted this:

```
recover: dig: over
over
```

At which point it printed a bunch messages like so:

```
/~hosneb-rosler/home/~2017.6.17..23.30.11..1a34/arvo/hoon
  <[11.103 15].[11.134 57]>
```

finally finishing up with:

```
bail: 3
|«ames»
```

And that ames prompt just spun and spun. Ctrl-D wouldn't exit the process. kill -2 just re-printed a bunch of stuff like the above and kill -9 finally killed it.

Upon restart, however, after looking okay at first, I once again got:

```
bail: meme

recover: top: meme
address 0xb61b4ef4 out of loom!
loom: [0x36000000 : 0xb6000000)

bail: oops
```

And a 2G stack dump. I was not doing anything on it and had made no changes recently. 
Help!
