[urbit-sync](https://github.com/ngzax/urbit-sync) is a small ruby script to initialize and synchronize your local filesystem and your mounted urbit pier.

I created this because it was useful for me at this very early stage of urbit's life. It lets me check out the repos I am working on and not worry about keeping the files in sync. It also lets me define the packages that I am including in my base pier setup so when one crashes, getting another one fully set up is a single command.

DISCLAIMER:

~rophex-hashes has been doing some great early work on a prototype for this
called urbit-package. See [his post on fora](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.9.7..23.20.06..dc47~/) 
and [the github repository](https://github.com/asssaf/urbit-package).

Please see the linked repo above for full instructions. I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions if you find this useful.
