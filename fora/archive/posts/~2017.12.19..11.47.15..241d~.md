Following what has been said on talk, I would like to 
understand more clearly what is the vision for Urbit on the frontend. 

According to ~rovnys-ricfer currently there is a lot of work 
being done wrt. Tree, Udon, and server-side rendering. 

Is preferable way to implement frontend to use Udon (and how would that work). Afaik Udon 
is a markup language. On the other hand, Tree frontend is a SAP written in React.
There seems to be some confusion, and I would appreciate someone more familiar with matter 
to shed some light. 

In the end, any moderately complex app will just be implemented using some front-end technology, unless I am missing some Urbit magic which is supposed to supplant this. 

For example, the Plato architecture is as follows:
Plato.hoon <--> Eyre <--> Plato.frontend (Elm)

I would imagine in some time someone would supplant the current welcome page with 
a SAP app, as seen in Galen demos. Is that preferable? Why/why not? What would the ultimate form of Urbit front end?
