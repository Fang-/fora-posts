Hey all! I'm here with a version 1 of a new toy, which I'm calling `:feed`. Below is a quick overview and a walkthrough on how to set the thing up and start playing with it.

As mentioned in [my last :fora post](https://urbit.org/~~/fora/posts/~2017.3.18..03.24.15..d6cd~/), I've been working on a simple hacky microblogging web UI on top of `:talk`, as well as a detailed tutorial writeup that progresses through the steps of building it. The UI is (painfully) vanilla, but it actually works well to highlight all the core functionality of our current `urb.js` and `:talk` web API's.

But the thing does work! By following these below steps, you'll create a `%feed` station and a UI which will allow you to subscribe and unsubscribe to other ships' `%public` `:talk` stations (which boot with your ship by default). Then through your UI you can view all of your subscribed ships' `%public` posts in your personal `%feed` via a single chronological timeline. And new posts will load at the top of your page in real time.

The goal of this demo was to show that building a Twitter replacement actually isn't that hard at all; and it can be done almost entirely on the frontend. As shown, you don't even have to use React/Redux. But that's probably the way to go if you want to build the real thing.

Anyways, enough *:talk*.

### 1. Make sure you have a desk `|synced` with latest maintenance and `|mounted` to Unix

`~pittyp` and I had to fix a few of `%eyre`, `%gall` and `%zuse` bugs on maintenance for `:feed` work. We just sent an update out over the network which should have synced if you're on a planet. But to be safe, you should do the following before continuing:

**1.1** Create a new desk that's separate from your `%home` desk, and have the new desk pull directly from your parent's `%kids` desk (which is on latest maintenance). You can name the desk whatever you like, but I'll call it `%feed-desk` here. You can do this with the following `:dojo` command:

```
> |merge %feed-desk (sein our) %kids
```

This should result in a blank/fresh `%feed-desk`.

You might want to additionally |sync this desk with your parent:

```
> |sync %feed-desk (sein our) %kids
```

*1.2* Next, you need to `|serve` your new `%feed-desk` to the web:

```
> |serve %feed-desk
```

> Note that if you had been serving a blog, site or other files on your `%home` or other `|served` desk, these will stop serving to the web temporarily. If you really want to keep serving this stuff, you can try running your `%feed` through the steps below on your main desk, which will work fine if your desk is synced to maintenance, or will throw some errors if not (your desk shouldn't break and your ship certainly shouldn't crash -- if they do, this is a bug; let us know).

*1.3* Mount your new desk to your Unix machine so you can add the `:feed` code to your new desk to serve to the web.

```
> |mount /=feed-desk=
```

Now, in addition to your main mounted desks in your ship's Unix `pier`, your new desk should be there:

```
$ ls path/to/ship/pier
home  feed-desk
```

### 2. Get `:feed`'s frontend code into your ship

The frontend code for `:feed` is stored in my [`keatondunsford/feed`](https://github.com/keatondunsford/feed) repo. To get this code onto your ship:

*2.1* Turn off your ship.  This is a good idea when you're going to sync a bunch of files at once.
*2.2* In your Unix terminal, `cd` into your ship's new desk's `web` directory and clone my `:feed` repo into it:

```
$ cd path/to/ship/pier/feed-desk/web
$ git clone https://github.com/keatondunsford/feed.git
```

*2.3* Restart your ship.

If this worked, `%clay` should have noticed the newly imported files:

```
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/feed/html
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/init/html
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/package/json
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/'README'/md
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/feed/feed/css
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/feed/feed/js
+ /~tonlur-sarret/feed-desk/2/web/feed/feed/init/js
```

### 3. Initialize your `%feed` station

For this example we'll use two stations: `%feed` for following stations and `%public` for making posts.  Your `%public` station exists already, but we need to create `%feed` and subscribe `%public` to it.

I've made this easy for you by including an `init.html` file that makes the required calls via `urb.js`.

Assuming you're running your ship on `localhost`, load up `localhost:8443/feed/init.html`. If you're not running on `localhost`, it'd be something like `https://tonlur-sarret.urbit.org/feed/init.html`, or `server_ip:8443/feed/init.html` on your VPS, etc.

When initialization is complete you should see this button:

![A button appeared on the page.](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13459143/24977700/c4153142-1f82-11e7-8201-b74888cc600b.png)

It might take a few seconds for `%eyre` to process the `:talk-command`, so just be patient if nothing happens.  You can look in your browser dev tools Console to see the interesting stuff happening.

When your feed appears it should look like this:

![This is my :feed!](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13459143/24977702/c668050a-1f82-11e7-9937-ed859496938b.png)

### 4. Post!

Load any ship's `%public` station via the `Fetch` box at the top of the page, post a `%public` message and scroll through your feed when you're at your home page, and head back home whenever you're on another ship's page by clicking the `Home` button at the top of another ship's `%public` feed.

This is just a skeleton, but it'll be fun to get a few people using it to test it out.  Let me know in the comments, and I'll try fetching your `:feed`!

### 5. Tutorial

The plan is to turn this example into a complete written-up tutorial, but I wanted to share the code with everyone first.  For the time being, I'll be here in the comments to answer questions and would be happy to set a time to be around in `:talk`.

Hope you all think this is cool! Any and all feedback is much appreciated. Thanks in advance!
