So where is testing at right now? Test suites are now in their own files, and the test runner is smart enough to run only specific tests specified by the user:

```
    > +test /thr
    /thr/test-seconds OK
    /thr/test-partition OK
    /thr/test-firsts OK
    /thr/test-apply OK
    > +test /ls/test-drop-while-end
    /ls/test-drop-while-end OK
```

Tests form a hierarchical model now:

```
    |%
    +=  tests
      :>    a hierarchical structure of tests
      :>
      :>  an alphabetically sorted recursive association list
      :>  mapping a part of a path to either a test trap or a
      :>  sublist of the same type.
      (list (pair term (either (trap (list tape)) tests)))
    --
```

So everything's good? Ready to merge to master? Not quite. While all the test suites are being loaded from individual files in `%/tests`, it's not being done automatically; every test file is being loaded individually and put into a list of suites manually:

```
    ::  from the top of %/gen/test.hoon
    /=  test-thr  /:  /===/tests/thr  /!noun/
    /=  test-myb  /:  /===/tests/myb  /!noun/
    /=  test-ls  /:  /===/tests/ls  /!noun/
    /=  test-mp  /:  /===/tests/mp  /!noun/

    ::  at the bottom of %/gen/test.hoon
    ^-  tests
    :~
      ['ls' [%| (gen-tests !>(test-ls) eny)]]
      ['mp' [%| (gen-tests !>(test-mp) eny)]]
      ['myb' [%| (gen-tests !>(test-myb) eny)]]
      ['thr' [%| (gen-tests !>(test-thr) eny)]]
    ==
```

This means if you were to just add another test core to `%/tests`, it would not show up automatically when running the `+test` generator.

The final step is to automate the generation of the instance of the `++tests` list. Something like `/_`, but for a generic directory:

```
    /=  all-tests  /@  /===/tests  /!noun/
```

(Even better if it is somehow recursive, allowing a deeper directory structure which would be reflected in the recursive structure of `++tests`.)

However, I have no idea how to conceptually do the above. You can see the current testing code [here](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/blob/new-stdlib/gen/test.hoon).
