D: So I pitched you urbit from the bottom upâ€”a principled total reboot of computing, starting with a mathematical assembly language

D: Urbit from the top down is even more interesting (same as how blockchain is interesting from both the bottom and the top)

J: im all ears

D: Urbit is a reboot of politics and governance; it is a 256 seat senate which votes to change the rules of the network (future internet). Each senator owns 1/256th of the network address space. Routing is hierarchical

J: how are senators selected?

D: they are crypto assets

D: address space is crypto asset; a senator owns 1/256 of address space (and sells out subnets)

D: i own a 2^16 chunk of address space

D: And for the record, urbit had this figured out well before 2009

J: sure but vote power in crypto systems are determined somehow, either by compute power or staked coins or something

D: its not a blockchain

D: there is a piece of code, "the constitution" which is actually backed by an ethereum contract as of october i think

J: sure but the point is a senator needs to be selected through some process, the crypto side just tells us how that authority is transfered, not how the receipient of the authority is determined

D: the constitution is whats voted on by senators

D: Oh, seeding the initial 256 senators is not solved, i think there are like 50 right now

D: its supposed to go out to nation states or something, but its so far out in the future that it doesnt matter right now

D: today the senate is controlled by the founder

J: ahh

J: so still a human process most likely

D: they'd have to negotiate with the founder

D: you could probably buy one from him today


D: he probably gave some to his VCs

J: well this is all open source right?

D: yes

D: im trying to look up the senate right now

D: i know its hardcoded in the constituion

D: it moved to eth so i dont know how to find it lol

J: so nothing stopping someone from just forking the system and making up their own senators for their own version of the system and have two competing solutions

D: network effects

D: it's a software ecosystem (remember, bottom up pitch)

D: it would be like forking linux, good luck

J: well technically linux has been forked successfully. many times

D: Nobody runs the forks

D: it either merges upstream or it is a walled garden

D: read me charitably here pls

D: analogies are analgies

J: depends on how you define fork i suppose

J: patched versions of the kernel are run by lots of people

J: in fact id say its more popular than vanilla linux

D: suppose you change somethign fundamental

D: e.g. you want to throw out linus and allow restarting userland (a continuity breach of sorts since all existing binaries are now busted)

D: networke ffect makes that impossible

J: FreeBSD did that, and was relatively successful

D: crypto currency is different, its meant to be exchanged, which is why network effects are weaker

J: but generally I agree that running a fork only makes sense if your ideas are a positive enough of a change for people to be willing to accept the cost of switching networks

J: it could even be something as simple as a loss of trust int he founder's dictatorship over the senators, or not liking the choice of those senantors when they are selected

J: people obviously want open governance, by the people. They seem leary of handing over control of pervasive technologies to monolithic entities or governments

D: If the founder has <50% then the senators can change the constitution  code without his blessing

J: so how those senators are selected may turn out to make all the difference when it comes to urbits success

D: sure

J: yea but again that assumes the public actually likes the choice of senantors int he first place

D: the founder is a controversial political writer, his stuff is really good, ive been reading his books

D: he has ideas and a plan for all this

J: a system where the consumers dont have any voting power over who the senantors are is a problem to me

J: well i guess it just depends on what that plan is if he has much chance of success. I am ignorant to that so i cant say either waqy

D: he def doesn't believe in anacrhy or libertarian utopia, he believes democracy is broken in deep and fundamental ways

D: one of his ideas is that, my 2^16 subnet, since the network routing is a tree hierarchy, i have to pick a senator to do my routing

D: and if i dont like it, i can move to a differnt senator

D: so they have to compete

D: so if one senator says, my subnet will not route hate speech, i can change senators

D: Is your question about voting power answered?

J: as best it can

J: they get no voting power on senators

J: senantors can compete abd gain/loose clients. But no actual voting seems to take place to force a senator to give up their share

D: they "vote with their wallet"; it is a free market for the services that senators offer. Senator == 2017 nationstate; in urbit, if you don't like your nation laws, you can take your data and move it to a different nation

J: sure but thats not a vote as to who has senator rights, only a vote as to weather you trust them with your traffic

J: nothing stopping someone from being a senator with no clients under them

J: and still hold onto their senaator-ship

D: i dont know the answer to that question and it may be my very flawed and basic understanding that has caused the question

J: could be that too sure

J: just saying that seems to me to be a critical aspect of the potential of the system.

D: But if there was a senator with nobody under him; wouldn't users who are unhappy with their existing senator go to him and say "I will come to you if you do X" and thus it is self balancing

J: depends on how much the senator cares about having people under him, or if the senator even acts with his own best interest in mind, or even still has the resources to provide the services for that matter

J: lots of potential factors in play there

J: Tibet is a senator, tibet gets invaded and tibet gets whiped off the map. How does bill, the leader of the now defunt tibet loose his rights over senator-ship..

J: just an example

D: i dont know what an invasion looks like in a digital republic

J: That doesnt even touch on the actual technical difficults (which may be solved)

D: maybe firewalling network traffic or black-listing certain types of data eg hate speech

J: ialking am tbout a physical one, sinc eyou suggested the senators may be the governments themselves of the major nations

D: Maybe i shouldnt have said that, it was just an analogy

J: fair enough

D: The digital republic need not mirror the Earth

D: in fact it obviously wont

J: so we are really talking about 256 major ISP or backbone providers or something as more likely to be the senators

J: I think whoever may be the senators, governance here is still critical

D: no; (switching to bottom up technology discussion) the urbit network is entirely virtualized, the 2017-internet is an implementation detail and abstracted away

J: if it is ISP's orowners of backbones, well companies go bankrupt

D: i think it just doesnt matter, like blockchain will perist through whatever future versions of internet hardware

D: power struggles etc

J: I think regardless figuring out a democratic way to pick senators and ensure sneators can have their privilage revoked and given to someone else is critical to something like this taking off

D: i'll post this conversation on their forum and see what they say ðŸ™‚

D: is that ok? No names

J: yea fine by me, dont care if you use namesw either

D: in 2017 it doesn't actually matter who was born royalty, who was born a Kennedy, who was born into power in whatever nation, first world or third world. What matters is that there is someone in charge and that person has to compete. I think in urbit, the senatorship is recursive; a senator can have arbitrary rules underneath him. The next layer down can be a senate, or not, it is up to him to decide. Democracy, whatever structure it wants to enforce whatever rules for network, identity and data services on his subnet; and that is hierarchical/recursive (like UnitedNations/USA/state/local). The only layer that is fixed is the root layer, a fixed senate of 256 senators.

D: so, the UN for the digital frontier

J: yea but that makes the root layer's governance all the more important

D: I suppose you could always hack a senator and steal his keys, or go torture him and put him in jail etc

J: i like the idea that each senator has full kliberty to define the rules under him

J: but it just increases the need for good root level governance

D: Can i fork conv

J: hell a senator ould die when attacked by orcs and leave his private key (along with the one ring) at the bottom of a river somewhere for 1000 years too

J: yes fork as you wish

D: if the senator seats werent a fixed commodity then i wouldnt be as concerned

D: that might be able to be voted on, in fact it makes sense that this idea is coded into the constitution

D: so the senate can dissolve itself by changing that piece of code

J: I'd much prefer to see a system where anyone can be a senator at any time and the number of people that choose to subscribe under him effects the power that senator . may not work witht he underlying tech though

D: not sure if this is possible

J: yea may not work with the system as it currently exists

D: i think that might be possible anyway; if one of the senators said "im the anarchy nation, do what you want" and anyone who wants that can be under him

D: they can have their own unliminted senate

J: this has given me some ideas to think about on my own crypto though

J: so still useful for me

D: yes

D: Urbit is very important to both your research and mine, we need to talk about this a looot more in coming months

J: I agree

D: its too soon to say if im a fan boy, but the problem space itself is interesting enough to keep my attention alone

D: yes

D: 

```
[evilcorp has your data and you can't see it]
[evilcorp has your data and offers filtered access via a UI]
[evilcorp has your data and offers snapshots / queries]
[evilcorp has your data and lets you mirror it effectively]
[you have your data but let evilcorp mirror it effectively]
[you have your data but offer evilcorp queries]
```

D: that is also a problem Urbit is designed to solve

J: well i think those concerns are ones that many users would love to see solveds

J: so if it provides an effective solution to that it could really help boost the tech's adoption

D: urbit computers represent the user, not the corporation. The corporation has to send the code to the user, the user has the data, and the user can run the corporation code or their own

J: what if the corporation's code is proprietary and they dont want to share it?

D: Great q; the corp can always tunnel encrypted proprietary stuff. Urbit can't make this impossible, but urbit can give weapons in the fight against this. One of the weapons is that, programming in the Urbit abstraction layer is very simple (since it is deterministic and the programming primitives are mathematical, not imperative)

D: SO its a lot harder to be proprietary

D: Compare to 2017, where proprietary crapware is the natural outcome

D: its hard to not be shit today

D: in urbit, its hard to be shit
