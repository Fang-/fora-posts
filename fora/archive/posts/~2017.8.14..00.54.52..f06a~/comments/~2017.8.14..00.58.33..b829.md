Related, and probably important to mention: Web talk's JS code is shitty and makes a lot of assumptions about the kinds of messages people send. It falls over when it tries to render the messages the block.io app sends. This [has been fixed](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/420) and should hopefully have been pushed over the network already.  
Sorry for anyone who was inconvenienced by this!
