## `~silmud-rampel`
I'm getting a bit lost. Yesterday or maybe the day before, I did

```
    > |sync %examples ~ropmev-pocseb %examples
```

in the dojo and sync succeeded. I then did the subsequent commands and everything seemed OK. However, when I go into ${PIER}/ and run ls, I see examples/ and home/. The Project Euler examples are in ${PIER}/examples/gen/project-euler/, and the first one is p1.hoon. The top of p1.hoon says to run in dojo with +examples/project-euler/p001

In the dojo, however, it doesn't seem to work:

```
    ~nimsut_tomtyl:dojo/examples> +examples/project-euler/p001
    fame: no /~nimsut-mossem-parmul-disteb--solsec-hocfyl-tonbes-tomtyl/examples/1/gen/examples/project-euler/p001
    ford: core /~nimsut-mossem-parmul-disteb--solsec-hocfyl-tonbes-tomtyl/examples/~2017.9.14..05.09.43..c59c/gen/examples/project-euler/p001
```

Also, I've noticed slight discrepancies between the different copies of the code. The full Hoon solution at the top of <http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/basic/> _mostly_ matches ${PIER}/../p1.hoon, but has a commented-out line with "~sivtyv-barnel" in it.

Later on in the page, in the "Lines 13-15" section, ++sum's first argument is `a/@`, but up above, it's `a/@u`. Coming fresh from Urbytes 0 through 2, I know _just_ enough about auras to be confused by the difference between `@` and `@u` without going back and looking up the difference. I'm pretty sure `@` is unspecified and `@u` is an unlimited-length unsigned int, but that's without looking.

Hope this helps.
