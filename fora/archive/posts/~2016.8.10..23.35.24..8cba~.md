If you tinker with your ship's standard/Arvo files, you may get merge conflicts when a new version is pushed from your parent. You can resolve those manually, or you might just "set everything to it's latest "official" version.". Just do the following from dojo:

```
    |merge %home our %base, =gem %that
```

It'll take some time, roll a bunch of output by you, and then you should have the latest and greatest in Urbit compatible software!
