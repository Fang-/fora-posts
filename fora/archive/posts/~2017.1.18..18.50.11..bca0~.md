Hi All, 
I have no practical experience of urbit yet though I have read lots and got as far as obtaining a planet ticket.

If I had some hardware that is already being controlled by code I have control of (so I could extend that code  to listen on a socket for additional commands), where would I start with making it respond to commands sent to a :talk channel?
I guess I'd need an urbit to host the :talk channel, what's the simplest thing to do to just relay messages to a normal unix socket ?
