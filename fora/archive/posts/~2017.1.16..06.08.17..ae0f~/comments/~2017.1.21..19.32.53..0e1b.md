The practical question: How do I effectively grab data out of a core in a `%hold`? The current implementation in git actually does have a new stem in `++span` with proper jet modifications(1). For example, on my development fakezod:

    > ?? +2047
      [%docs 'layer one: arithmetic, tree addressing and molds' <|core|>]
    <33.tfg 2.wxc $149>
    >
    
This doesn't entirely help me in the case of trying to reference an individual arm:

    > ?? add
    [ %hold
      <|core|>
      [ %help
        p='Adds two unsigned integers.'
          q
        [ %funk p=lef=%add q=[ %gate [...] ]]]]
    >

The span in the hold appears to be the whole layer one core. I'm not sure how to proceed from here without looking at the twig tree. I suppose that maybe the span here could be `[%hold [%docs 'add two numbers' <|layer one core|>] add-twig]`, but that doesn't feel right because the %docs aren't describing the span it wraps. (And naively would print the arms assuming it's documentation to a core.)

(1): My kvetching on how hard it was to modify jets was mostly about modifying the existing `++foot`, which still doesn't entirely work. Just adding new cases such as {$docs p q} was mostly reasonable.
