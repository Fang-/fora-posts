My Hooning has been coming along nicely as of late and my Hoon theory developed to the point I started having a stab at the Arvo docs.

I thought I'd include my solutions to the even/odd Collatz Conjecture exercise here since I know a few other people are working through the Arvo docs:

https://github.com/SMCassidy/urbit/tree/master

I was surprised I could do them since it was only a few months ago I could barely write a factorial function. Those two even and odd apps are just for working on a single urbit but you can swap out our.bow for whatever @p you want to do it over the network. I just tried it and it's slow but it works!

I've done the app to print the last noun received too, but it isn't a proper solution as it doesn't deal with types and treats everything as a noun. So :last 'hi' will produce [%last 226.984]. Interested in knowing the proper way to do this, I think I need to know a bit more about how poke works first. Do I need a mark and arm for every type? Or is there a way to infer the type of a sample after its received and then handle it?

The docs also say by posting this I will receive a cookie, so I am drawing up an invoice to Tlon for a cookie redeemable spark token as part of the new constitution.
