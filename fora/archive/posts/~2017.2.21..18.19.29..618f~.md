Hi Folks, the VM running my first planet (sidser-salbex) had a rude host power interruption over the weekend and now if I try to restart it I get:

```
[root@localhost urbit-0.4.3]# bin/urbit sidser-salbex
~
urbit 0.4.3
urbit: home is sidser-salbex
loom: mapped 2048MB
protected loom
live: loaded: MB/146.259.968
boot: installed 239 jets

bail: oops
Aborted (core dumped)
```

Is there anything that can be done to get it back?
I've not got any priceless work on there or anything but, you know, it was my first and I feel a strange attachment to it so want to do my best to revive the little fella :)
