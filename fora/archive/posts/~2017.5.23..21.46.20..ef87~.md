Hello. I was looking at the whitepaper from last year, and found a lacuna on the pdf's page ten. In the paragraph beginning "Symmetry breaking" the end seems to have been cut off after "relationship between the" and the next paragraph seems to be missing the beginning as it picks up with "identity of the node".

When convenient, may we have the original text?

Regards,
