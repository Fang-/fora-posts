`~master-morzod` gave what I thought was a clear and intuitive explanation of the ~; rune in `urbit-meta`.  It seemed too helpful not to share here in an edited transcript.

It started with me asking about parsers:

```
~taglux-nidsep+ would you mind helping me get a bird's eye view?
~taglux-nidsep+ simple stuff like "what's an edge?" in intuitive terms
~master-morzod+ so ++hair is {line column}
~master-morzod+ ++nail is {hair tape}
~taglux-nidsep+ hair is just for stack trace, right?
~taglux-nidsep+ oh wait
~taglux-nidsep+ hoon.hoon says parsing trace
~taglux-nidsep+ um, what's a parsing trace?
~master-morzod+ it's "parser context"
~taglux-nidsep+ still fuzzy...
~master-morzod+ ++edge is {hair (unit {* nail})}
~master-morzod+ how far you parsed, result, remaining input
```
For an example, `~master` input this:

`(alf [1 1] "a")`

Resulting in:

`[p=[p=1 q=2] q=[~ u=[p='a' q=[p=[p=1 q=2] q=""]]]]`

```
~taglux-nidsep+ first hair is how much, * is result, nail is remaining?
~master-morzod+ that's right
~taglux-nidsep+ ok
~taglux-nidsep+ that's very helpful
~master-morzod+ parsers are just functions from {hair tape} to edge
~taglux-nidsep+ so that hair essentially keeps track of progress
~taglux-nidsep+ and the edge gives a new hair with the updated progress
~master-morzod+ yeah, it's basically a cursor into the input
~taglux-nidsep+ ok
~master-morzod+ the hair in the sample is a starting point
~taglux-nidsep+ aha
~master-morzod+ so there's parser functions themselves
~master-morzod+ parser "transformers" like ++full
~master-morzod+ and then parser combinators ++pfix, ++pose, ++plug
~master-morzod+ and then there's ;~
~taglux-nidsep+ the infamous ;~ twig
~master-morzod+ it's actually less complicated than the explanations
~master-morzod+ you're familiar with function composition
~taglux-nidsep+ yes, function composition
~master-morzod# `@t`((cork crip dec) "bbc")  'abc'
~master-morzod+ and ;:, which nests calls to a binary gate
~master-morzod# (:(cork crip dec trip some) "bbc")  [~ u="abc"]
~taglux-nidsep+ is :() the irregular form of ;:?
~master-morzod+ yeah, that's right
~taglux-nidsep+ ok
~master-morzod+  ;~ is "user-defined" function composition
~master-morzod+ (at least, that's how i think of it)
~taglux-nidsep+ one sec...
~taglux-nidsep+ what is some?
~master-morzod+ make a unit
~taglux-nidsep+ oh
~taglux-nidsep+ ok
~master-morzod# (some 'body')  [~ u='body']
~taglux-nidsep+ got it
~master-morzod+ with ;~, you use a gate as an adaptor between functions
~master-morzod+ instead of just nesting them directly
```

Another `~master` example:

`(;~(|*({a/* b/gate} [%glue a (b a)]) crip dec trip some) "bbc")`

Result:

`[%glue 'bbc' %glue 6.513.249 %glue "abc" ~ u="abc"]`

```
~master-morzod+ that glue gate can arbitrarily filter, transform, or condition
~master-morzod+ the pipeline of gates
~taglux-nidsep+ ok, very very roughly.... it gives you a way of saying you want
~taglux-nidsep+ to do fancy stuff above and beyond nesting gates
~taglux-nidsep+ ?
~taglux-nidsep+ and it allows you to define that arbitrarily?
~master-morzod+ exactly
~master-morzod+ the adaptor takes the sample and the next gate
~taglux-nidsep+ okay, so in your example, we take "bbc" and the gate "crip" and
~taglux-nidsep+ those are passed to the wet gate
~taglux-nidsep+ and then dec and the last result are passed to the wet gate
~taglux-nidsep+ and so on?
~master-morzod+ that's it
~taglux-nidsep+ that's not that bad
~taglux-nidsep+ great explanation
~master-morzod+ it can get complicated 'cause the adapter hides its state
~master-morzod+ that's also what makes it analogous to a monad
~master-morzod+ (as far as i can tell ... that's out of my depth)
~taglux-nidsep+ is the wet gate the adapter?
~master-morzod+ yeah
~master-morzod+ it's producing that [%glue ...] cell for every invocation
~taglux-nidsep+ i'm not really sure what you mean by "hides its state"
~master-morzod+ but the pipeline of gates never sees that product
~taglux-nidsep+ ah
~taglux-nidsep+ right
~master-morzod+ it's kind of like a two-level fold or reduce
```
