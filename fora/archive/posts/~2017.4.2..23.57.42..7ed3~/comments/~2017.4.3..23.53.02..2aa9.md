~fosnut I'm not convinced that's an issue here. 

It seems to me that if the user has deleted data, the fetch just blocks, like any referent which can't currently be resolved.

For speedier resolution it could return a %four-oh-four error, to absolve the app itself from the decision that this particular loop is in fact infinite. That breaks referential transparency, but in a way we might want.
