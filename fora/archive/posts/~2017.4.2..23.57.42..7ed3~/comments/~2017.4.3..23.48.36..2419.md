One question worth asking here is whether it's desirable for all %gall apps to be able reach into the past. Are there legitimate reasons to support complete deletion of data in a %gall app. (i.e. legal reasons, anonymity, desire to be forgotten). Is that a right that urbit users/developers should have?

If the answer is yes then these features would need to be configurable per app and then you have to decide which should be the default.
