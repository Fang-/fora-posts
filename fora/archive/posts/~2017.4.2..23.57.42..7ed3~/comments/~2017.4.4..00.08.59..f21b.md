Ah, I was addressing the client side of the equation.

There is of course no possible way to forbid the server/host from deleting data. 

It would be possible to write a %gall that breaks badly if certain revisions or other state is deleted, say by requiring that each revision sign the prior and refusing to proceed if we're missing a block in the chain. So let's not do that. 

I was addressing the related question, what happens if a guest/client requests a revision that the server/host has deleted. Since 'real' referential transparency requires the same result, the only clean option is to fail/block. In the fallen world of impurity we're mired within, it might save everyone time to just fess up that you done broke it.
