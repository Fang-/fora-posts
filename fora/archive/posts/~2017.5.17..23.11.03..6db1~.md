Hello. I have revived a very old planet I had, in light of the public sale, and ran into some strange issues:

+ Talk starts with a + prompt, not a >
+ The documentation does not appear to show any way of listing stations and their associated prompts, nor any way of "switching" the active station.
+ When attempting to join urbit-meta, I am presented with the following (error? status?):

```
--------------| ;join /urbit-meta
--------------| has glyph '='
--------------| porch: hey '=' /urbit-meta
```
