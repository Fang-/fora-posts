We finished the test case that was broken, `+test-double-alts`; it surfaced another case where we weren't cleaning up after a build properly. Fixed that.

We started a cleanup pass today, where we encapsulated a bunch of repeated jug manipulation. Also started cleaning up +reduce. Added some comments.
