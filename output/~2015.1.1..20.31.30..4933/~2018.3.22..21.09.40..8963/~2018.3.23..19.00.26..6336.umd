Good question. We ship Arvo source updates over the network, but updates to the C Nock interpreter, Vere, have to continually be pulled from Github. We're in the process of making installing Urbit a lot easier via a simple shell script to curl. We'll probably also add update and upgrade scripts to ease this process as well.
