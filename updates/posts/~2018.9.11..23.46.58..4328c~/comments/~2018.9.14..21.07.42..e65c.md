I can talk about one change.  The `+=` rune for arms has been replaced with `+$`.  It does basically the same thing, but is easier to read in code as defining a type.  (Think of the `$` family of runes.)

For type constructor arms, instead of using the wet gate `|*` rune, the `+*` rune is used.  See the changes to `list` in the code to see how it works.  [https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/sys/hoon.hoon#L302](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/release-candidate/sys/hoon.hoon#L302)

There are other changes too (some still in progress) but these are the ones with which I'm familiar.  `~taglux`
