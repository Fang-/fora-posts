## `~master-morzod`
I've revived `~mardev` and recreated the transcript for the first session: [http://mardev.urbit.org/whitepaper/](http://mardev.urbit.org/whitepaper/).

I'm really looking forward to part 2 -- aiming for this Friday (06/17) at 9:30 ET. I'll be creating a *private* hangout with a *public* youtube livestream (to avoid repeating the logistical issues from the first session). Please comment below if you'd like to be in the hangout.
