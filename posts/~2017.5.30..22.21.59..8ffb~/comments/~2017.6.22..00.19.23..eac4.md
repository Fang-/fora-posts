If i may, I'd like to ask a sincere question.
Is Urbit simply a peer to peer chat architecture? Yes i have read the documentation but it gets pretty deep pretty quick into the lingo. the idea seems predicated on governance of a virtual space (a literal anarchic system if i understand correctly). i have an intense interest in learning about this but honestly, people will want to ask very odd things like "can i live stream video?" and will it "do" netflix?  not now, but maybe later??
I have no idea how to answer these things.

i am not off on a tangent here, i would like to know these things so i can better appreciate the potential of the project.
Please do forgive my ignorance in these questions.
