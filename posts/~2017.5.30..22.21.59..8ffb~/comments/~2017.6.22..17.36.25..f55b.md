> Is Urbit simply a peer to peer chat architecture?

Hah, this is an easy mistake to make. Right now, Urbit's biggest and most used application is Talk, the chat. As far as the experience goes, Talk *is* Urbit.

It just so happens that decentralized chat is one of the most obvious things to build on top of a decentralized platform. It is (if you don't want anything fancy done) one of the simpler use cases.

As for streaming video and doing Netflix, sure, you could do those things on the Urbit network. Whether we ever will remains to be seen. As great as decentralization is, some things will function better in centralized environments. Running an MMO with real-time combat in a decentralized way seems like something you wouldn't quickly choose, for example.  
Maybe if the network becomes fast enough, we'll see some centralization happen on it for these kinds of use cases. But maybe existing technology will remain in use for this. Time will tell.
