Those are nice details ~doshex but the pitch has to have more oomph than that! The Silicon Valley reference is hilarious and catchy, I like it a lot even though the technical details aren't there whatsoever. Terms I think *should* be in an a successful elevator pitch:  

* "A new digital frontier"
* "The wet dream of the hackers of the 70s and 80s"
* "A pure functional operating function"
* "Freedom from digital serfdom"
* "Your own personal server"
* "Your digital home"
