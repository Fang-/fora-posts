## `~pittyp-datfyn`
`+=` is a different syntax in the same way that the head of `^-` and `|=`, or indeed the inside of a `,[@ @]`, was a different syntax in 169.

`(pair @ term)` is one of the rare occasions where you *don't* have any ambiguity: normally, you have tuples, faces, or cubes in your types, and having `/` mean `=` and `{}` mean `[]`(but also interpolation) is just too unwieldy. `(a b c)` still means slam, now it just means "slam with arguments in the same syntax we're already in".

`=/  a  ?((list [a=@ b=@]))` will still work the same as `=/  a  (list {a/@ b/@})`: it's a bit ugly, and perhaps we'll end up back with having the `,` one-character prefix syntax, but sorreg's thesis is that making types in the middle of twigs is rare enough that we should let it stand out as weird. I'm probably the heaviest user of such ad-hoc types, though mostly mine jump immediately into `$_` and will thus be unaffected.
