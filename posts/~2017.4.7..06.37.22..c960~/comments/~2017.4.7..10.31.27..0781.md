## `~palfun-foslup`
To copy what I shouted into urbit-meta:

> `(list [p=@ q=@])`, which is clearly the optimal syntax...

I'm not 100% sure how to feel about this yet. I want to say `{p/@ q/@}` is better for reading, since it screams "hey this is a mold", but then if you broaden your view to the context you can see that's what's expected here anyway. Also it *is* visually consistent with, eg, `(list ship)` in a way...

Doccords syntax looks really sweet! It'll take some getting used to, but proper good syntax highlighting will help in viewing `:>` as "not code".  
I'm curious to hear why `+=` was chosen instead of, say `+~`. My brain can't help to think of `=+` when it sees `+=`, since they're both so common (now) and look so similar. Luckily, I don't expect we'll see them near each other often. (I have the same with `^=` and `=^` though, so it may be just me...)
