*I don't really see the need for being able to formally define the internal pin foo is a bar*

You could be debugging, you could have a breakpoint... in any case, I don't expect *all* formal decoration to be used formally.  Makes sense to keep the syntax uniform, though.

Trust me on the disambiguation problem -- you won't come up with an intrinsic way to tell what `(pair @ @)` is.  It has to be either from context, or in the syntax.

pittyp, that permutation should work fine, as it traverses the whole tree to look for the faces.  I prefer the other style a little better, however.
