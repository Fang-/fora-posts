```
~palfun-foslup: what's keeping talk from using the name you enter into your
~palfun-foslup: homepage as "default nickname"?
~wicdev-wisryt: i think talk should do that, ~palfun
~wicdev-wisryt: a pr would probably generate lively discussion
~wicdev-wisryt: or a fora post so you don't have to do the work
```

It's not the weekend yet, so I can't do the work.

Ship names are sort of memorable, but they're not who people identify as (well, most don't) and they make it hard to know who is who. You can't tell I'm `Fang-` on Github unless you've chatted me up for a bit, and even then you may get me confused with someone who has a similar ship name.

We can set our name on our Urbit's homepages, right? Why not have talk refer to those (aka data in the `web.plan` file) and display them as "default nicknames"? You'd still be able to override them with `;nick`, and it'd still show ship names if the user didn't set their name.

Good idea, y/n? Any alternate/better approaches to this?

Also, related: I think it's a good idea (for the future) to hide ship names behind more meaningful, personal aliases as far as end-user UI is concerned. Is this in the long-term plans, or are ship names planned to remain a core part of the experience for every user, aside from "logging in" and whatnot?
