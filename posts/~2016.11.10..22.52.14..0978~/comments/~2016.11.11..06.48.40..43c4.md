Title should be "Windows" obviously, bother :).

In other news, I was very very sadly wrong. Urbit will run in a Docker container, but routing seems to be broken in a significant way. For any brave souls who would like to try harder than I did, I got to a point where it seemed like switching to host networking, forwarding ports 8080, 12321, and a random one for UDP, and explicitly using that random UDP port made things a tiny bit more consistent.

Good luck and godspeed.
