Here's another (equivalent) reduction of nock 8, `*[a 8 b c]`---perhaps it's a little more clear:

    1.  *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]                       :: def. of nock 8
    2.  *[a 2 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] 1 c]                     :: def. of nock 7
    3.  *[*[a [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1]] *[a 1 c]]               :: def. of nock 2
    4.  *[[*[a [7 [0 1] b]] *[a 0 1]] *[a 1 c]]          :: def. of nock tuple
    5.  *[[*[a [2 [0 1] 1 b]] *[a 0 1]] *[a 1 c]]        :: def. of nock 7
    6.  *[[*[*[a [0 1]] *[a 1 b]] *[a 0 1]] *[a 1 c]]    :: def. of nock 2

And notice now that we're back at the same step 6 as in the original reduction.  So, as before:

    7.  *[[*[*[a [0 1]] *[a 1 b]] *[a 0 1]] c]   :: *[a 1 c] => c (def. of nock 1)
    8.  *[[*[*[a [0 1]] b] *[a 0 1]] c]          :: *[a 1 b] => b (def. of nock 1)
    9.  *[[*[*[a [0 1]] b] a] c]                 :: *[a 0 1] => a (def. of nock 0)
    10. *[[*[a b] a] c]                          :: *[a [0 1]] => a (def. of nock 0)
