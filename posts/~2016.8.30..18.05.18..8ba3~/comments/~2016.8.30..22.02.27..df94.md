I've been trying to get Urbit running on my rpi3 (I had to use clang instead of gcc for nvt.c during build) and the default swap size on Raspberry Pi is only 100Mb so it doesn't boot yet, increasing this is hazardous due to the SD card only having limited read/write capability I'm told which will reduce its lifespan, but I'm fairly sure I can remember someone posting a guide for rpi swap configuration in the chat before. Does anyone here have the link or know what I'm talking about?
