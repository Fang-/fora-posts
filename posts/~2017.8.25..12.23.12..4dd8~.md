I have been working on a single command cloud provision and deploy for urbit for a bit and finally have it working for AWS using terraform. The process itself is still a bit involved (9 steps) due to the need to set up your AWS user and credentials (and which I don't think can be fully remotely automated?), but hopefully my post/README explain the AWS setup part pretty clearly.

I would love any feedback and suggestions for improvement if you try to use it. I am currently working on a similar approach using ansible which will have the benefit of being able to provide additional management ability such as updating your yum packages, &c. without having to ssh to the server.

The git repo is here: https://github.com/ngzax/urbit-devops
