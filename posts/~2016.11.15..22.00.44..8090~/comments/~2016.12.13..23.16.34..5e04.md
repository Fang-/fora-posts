On a kind of random note, I think that talk's 64-character limit per line makes for some interesting UI possibilities. You could have screen/tmux style vertical splits on a sufficiently wide window and have different conversations going in each, with some easy keystroke to move between them. I know that implementation on that could be really hard though. Just figured I'd toss it out there. (Man, I've been using :talk too much. I almost forgot that capital letters exist)
