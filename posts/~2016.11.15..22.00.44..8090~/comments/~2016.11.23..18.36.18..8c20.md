Point taken on tmux.  Additionally, as was recently pointed out in :talk, there is currently no way to have :talk messages not show up in :dojo while you're in the middle of something else, without also disabling the :talk web client.

That said, I can't see Urbit decoupling from Unix anytime in the next decade or so.  What's probably a first step for that is Urbit decoupling from the command line and existing entirely as a service.  Although I admit I don't have nearly the grasp of the internals of Urbit to guess how the IO for that might work.
