You can see a rough mockup of what I was thinking [here](http://urbit.s3.amazonaws.com/etc/urbit-cli-panels.png).  There's more detail about how I think scrollback works and stuff.

What I had imagined was basically similar to the way `screen` works with the 'hard status' option on.  I hadn't thought about having multiple tabs for a particular process.  I like the idea of having a tab per-station.  

I would imagine creating a tab as similar to creating a new document.  When you create it you can set some options â€” like what the thing is listening to.  It could be listening to an app, or a specific path within an app.

Hm.  I wish I could have someone give a demo of what you are talking about.  I don't use emacs, but it sounds interesting.
