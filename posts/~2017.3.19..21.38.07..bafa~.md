https://github.com/zaphar/nock-repl implements a simple repl for the nock specification in rust. The rust code is not written for speed or performance but for readability instead. I also make no guarantees that I did everything correctly but I think I got pretty close.

I wrote it because frankly the dojo makes a pretty difficult to use nock repl and sometimes when playing with nock expressions you just want to feed a file to something and see output. Maybe someone will find it of interest?
