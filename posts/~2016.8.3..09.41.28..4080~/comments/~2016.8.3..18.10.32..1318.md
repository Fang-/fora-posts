## `~fyr`
The correct place for this is <http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/>, though the current contents are dreadfully out of date. I will also plug [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ohAitch/13488b9de2c7fd9dbc0b7bf2439dd46c) for a simple app poke flow, and happily answer any questions about the three-legged "get csrf-token(oryx), use token to get authenticated token, use second token to authenticate poke" it entails (or the livescript syntax implementing it :P). Subscriptions involve a long-poll and separate requests to PUT/DELETE things delivered over it; I'll try to get the correct eyre doc up, but meanwhile would recommend looking at the Network dev-tools panel on <http://urbit.org/stream>, or for that matter a local copy of [the `%click` example app](https://github.com/urbit/examples/tree/master/gall/click).
