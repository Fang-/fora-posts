Thanks ~fyr, I'll give that commit a spin in the next couple of days.

In the meantime, I have one question, around [authentication](http://urbit.org/~~/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/#-1-3-authentication):

It recommends `POST`ing to `/~/auth.json?PUT`, and `POST`ing to `/~/auth.json?DELETE`, as well. What's up with the `?PUT` etc at the end of the URL?
