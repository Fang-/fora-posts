I'm taking an interesting little chat from /urbit-meta and posting it here for posterity:

```
~rophex-hashes+ does +code actually change over time?
~rophex-hashes+ or isn't implemented yet
~tabtug-fidmyr+ is there a way to print what is bound to code unevaluated?
-------[42.650]
~tabtug-fidmyr+ like if i run +code what gets executed?
~littel-ponnys+ %gen/code/hoon
~littel-ponnys+ and if you look at that hoon file, you'll see that its scrying
~littel-ponnys+ into the ames namespace
~tabtug-fidmyr+ is there a way to get at that source at runtime or is it
-------[42.655]
~tabtug-fidmyr+ compiled away?
~tabtug-fidmyr+ *or interpreted?*
~littel-ponnys+ it's compiled, but the file is really short.
~littel-ponnys+ 2 lines that aren't
~littel-ponnys+ boilerplate
-------[42.660]
       ~siddev+ so to break that interesting pair of lines down...
       ~siddev+ it looks like it is casting the result of something to the @p 
       ~siddev+ aura (so it looks like a planet name)
~littel-ponnys+ correct
       ~siddev+ but i can seem to figure out a way to run scot in :dojo to 
-------[42.665]
       ~siddev+ figure out what it does
~littel-ponnys+ and that thing it's doing is a scry
~littel-ponnys+ scrys are one of the basic nock things
~littel-ponnys+ where from inside your program, you reach into the sky
~littel-ponnys+ and receive data
-------[42.670]
       ~siddev+ scry is an apt name
~littel-ponnys+ so most code in urbit is run in ++mock, the nock interpreter 
~littel-ponnys+ written in hoon
~littel-ponnys+ this is for sandboxing reasons
~littel-ponnys+ and so that a crash doesn't take your entire ship out
-------[42.675]
~littel-ponnys+ but sometimes you want to get data from outside your program
~littel-ponnys+ so the mock interpreter has a way to specify a function which 
~littel-ponnys+ gets read when the program inside scrys
~littel-ponnys+ this is a kernel function
~littel-ponnys+ break it down:
-------[42.680]
~littel-ponnys+ .^( ) <- the call to scry
~littel-ponnys+  @p <- cast result to this
~littel-ponnys+ %a <- the kernel module that recieves the scry
~littel-ponnys+ /some/path/thing <- this means different things to different 
-------[42.685]
~littel-ponnys+ kernel modules, but is passed to the function which %a resolves 
~littel-ponnys+ to.
       ~siddev+ ohh i see
       ~siddev+ so the /scot/code/scot/scot thing is a path. it looks like it 
       ~siddev+ has the current date and time in it
-------[42.690]
       ~siddev+ but what is p.bec
~littel-ponnys+ p.bec should resolve to our
~littel-ponnys+ aka, your ship identity
~littel-ponnys+ bec is a beak
~littel-ponnys+ a beak is [ship desk case]
-------[42.695]
~littel-ponnys+ p.bec is the ship
