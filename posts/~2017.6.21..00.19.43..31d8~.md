I have been doing some React+Redux development to get "with it" and I have encountered an issue that I'd appreciate some help with.

As is the rage nowadays, I have my whole frontend infrastructure (code, bundler, dev server, etc.) running on one port and my back end (a %gall app in this case) running on another.

From what I've read, %eyre handles authenticating requests by injecting an oryx, or a csrf token, into files that it serves.

My question is this: what is one to do if the ui files are not served from eyre? I'd prefer to not build all of my front end files and serve them from eyre during development, since i've gotten used to all of the cushy dev tools.
