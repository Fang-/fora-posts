## `~fyr`
Re: `($%({$a ^} {$b ^}) [%b 0])`, similarly `({a/^ b/@} [0 4])`produces `[[0 0] 4]`, because "composing two molds via cons/fork preserves their behavior" is currently given higher precedence than which *specific* value of the right span molds produce.

The problem I have with bunts in the sample is bunt is currently defined as "burned mold", and since axil molding semantics and mold composition semantics need to be defined anyway, defining partially-compatible semantics for bunts just confuses things. If `%$` discriminants should only appear in the first position, disallow them outside the first position; don't introduce circular conceptual dependencies.
