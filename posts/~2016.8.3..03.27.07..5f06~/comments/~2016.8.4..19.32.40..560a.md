Definitely, `$^` is a backwards fork.

Can we put herbs in holds (or, rather, give hold semantics to herbs) to get around this? Consider my fancy human reasoning when attempting to bunt `foo` in the above example.

- kick foo, i.e. `(foo *)`. this produces `{$~ (bar *)}`, so the bunt is a cell of 0 and something.
- `(bar *)` produces a unit of something. since i lazily try to bunt unit before descending into the fork case, i get 0. so the overall bunt is [0 0].

This is a bit unsavory in its own way, since Hoon is by no means lazy, but no actual "call semantics" are harmed - we're just reasoning about some twigs during *macro expansion*.
