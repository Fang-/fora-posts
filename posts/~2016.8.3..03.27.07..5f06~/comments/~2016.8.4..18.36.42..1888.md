## `~fyr`
imo trying to give clams a non-0 `*` sample feels like it's trying to be way too clever. Is there any way to formalize an (imperfect) clam behavior that bunts then follow, such that "`{$1 @}` turns into basically `|=(a/* ?@(a $(a [0 0]) [($1 -.a) (@ +.a)]))`" from the docs is actually true? My priority is the compiler being predictable over things like `ache` being possible.
