The culprit for some of this stuff is (probably) the changes to `++span`:

```
++  span  $@  $?  $noun                                 ::  any nouns
                  $void                                 ::  no noun
              ==                                        ::
          $%  {$atom p/term q/(unit @)}                 ::  atom / constant
              {$cell p/span q/span}                     ::  ordered pair
              {$core p/span q/coil}                     ::  object
              {$face p/$@(term tomb) q/span}            ::  namespace (new)
              {$fork p/(set span)}                      ::  union
              {$hold p/span q/twig}                     ::  lazy evaluation
```

The `$fork` case was changed from `(list span)` to `(set span)`, meaning the first element of a fork is entirely unpredictable, because it's based on a hash order used to balance the binary trees that `set`s are made of. Not nondeterministic, but unpredictable. This should definitely be changed back.
