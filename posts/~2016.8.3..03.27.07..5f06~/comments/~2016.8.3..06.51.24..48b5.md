Plenty of mold gates don't default to their sample:

```
> +6:$1
0
```

And the thing is, ++clam is what *generates* those gates in many cases, so if we're going to rely on a consistent bunt, ++clam better be able to figure it out, or it risks creating gates with accidental defaults. How do you obtain the sample for `=+  a=@  $%({$a a} {$b *})`? Is there any way to pull a reasonable default from an arbitrary gate twig other than by compiling it against a subject?
