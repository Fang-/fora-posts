Fwiw, I'm still skeptical that bunts in the clam sample are feasible. But I had trouble parsing your second paragraph - which partially compatible semantics are you referring to?

The bunt *twig* is defined as a burned version of the twig produced by ++bunt:al. Burn is just an optimization, so semantically it should suffice to define a mold's bunt as the value produced by kicking its clam. How that value actually gets produced is an implementation detail. It only becomes circular if you treat bunt samples as part of the definition of clams, rather than just a mechanism to ensure a particular bunt.

I'm guessing the composition semantics will need to change anyway if molds like ++tanq are to be salvaged, but maybe it's possible to fix that one transparently.
