The second bullet point is where you run into trouble, because there's no way to know what `(bar *)` produces at expansion time. We don't even know that the argument is `*`, since we're actually passing foo's argument to it. All we see is `[%call [%wing ~[%bar]] ~[[%wing ~[%a]]]]`. Likewise, all bar sees is `[%call [%wing ~[%unit]] ~[[%call [%wing ~[%foo]] ~[[%wing ~[%a]]]]]`. Herbs can't get any hold-ier without a subject span.

In the realm of theoretical possibility, I suppose you might be able to do something crazy like generate a twig wrapped with `!>` and pass the result to something that generates a bunt from a span, but that's way beyond merely unsavory. IMO, it's better to bite the bullet and just handle this stuff in ++ut if it really needs a span that badly.

Maybe it could be handled with a less drastic change than pulling ++al entirely into ++ut, though. Something like an extra primitive to allow injecting laziness at the right places, when spans are in play. (Complete hand-waving, I haven't really given that any thought.) I don't think it would help address the issues with ++whip and direct recursion, but that seems solvable by tweaking how ++whip generates code and disallowing direct recursion in the head of a cell mold (except in `$^`, of course). Probably not too onerous of a restriction.
