> clams to produce the bunt when slammed on a value of wrong span

I was going to bring this up, because it seems reasonable but it's not what happens currently (even when the clam kick agrees with the bunt):

```
> ($%({$a ^} {$b ^}) [%a 0])
[%a 0 0]
> ($%({$a ^} {$b ^}) [%b 0])
[%b 0 0]
```

Those all look like desirable properties to me, modulo one small tweak regarding what constitutes "first". For `$^` it makes sense to bunt to the second sub-twig, since the typical use specifies a recursive pair that can't serve as a bunt.
