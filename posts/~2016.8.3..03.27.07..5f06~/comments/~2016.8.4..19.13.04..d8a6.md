Sure, it's easy to fix the order discrepancy if you're okay privileging 0 cases - just delete the ++bunt cases for `?($bush $fern $kelp $reed)` and replace them with `(home [%rap [%limb %$] clam])`. To default to the first case instead of the last, prepend a `=.  p.sec  =>((flop p.sec) ?>(?=(^ .) .))` line to ++whip's $fern and $kelp cases.

It doesn't seem particularly more predictable to me than an antibunt in the clam, though. And it adds quite a lot of imperfection to the explanation. Instead of "books and picks default to their first case", we have "books and picks default to their first case, except that books default to any 0-tagged case instead, and picks default to any constant zero or `@` cases, and picks override books". I can already see the Scott Meyers *Effective Hoon* guideline, "Avoid 0 tags in books to ensure unsurprising defaults".
