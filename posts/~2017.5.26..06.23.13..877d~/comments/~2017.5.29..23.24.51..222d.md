Here's a version of the prime checker that uses a better algorithm.  It's a bit faster:

```
!.
|=  n/@                    
^-  @f               
?:  (lth n 2)
  %.n
?:  (lth n 4)
  %.y
=/  count  2
=/  lower  1
=/  upper  n
=/  test-value  (div (add n 1) 2)
|-  
?:  =((mul test-value count) n)
  %.n
?:  =(+(count) n)
  %.y
?:  =(+(lower) upper)
  ?:  =((mul +(test-value) count) n)
    %.n
  $(count +(count), lower 2, upper (dec n), test-value (div (add n 1) 2))
?:  (gth (mul test-value count) n)
  $(upper test-value, test-value (div (add test-value lower) 2))
$(lower test-value, test-value (div (add test-value upper) 2))
```

If you test "10.222.715" on the first version, you'll have to wait a minute for the answer: "1" for "no".  The new version should return an immediate answer "%.n".  The algorithm is still very simple, of course, and easily improved upon.
