You're fine to just hodl your Urbit assets for now. The code you received will maintain its balance of the one star you bought.

We have changes in the near future that will move asset ownership from our own databases onto the Ethereum blockchain. I'm not entirely sure what we'll do with codes that have remaining balance. If you need to do anything, we'll definitely sent emails out explaining what's going on and what needs to be done, but you're probably gonna be fine just idling for a while. (:
