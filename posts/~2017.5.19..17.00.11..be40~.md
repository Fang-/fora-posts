I type the command 

urbit -c mycomet

after doing so I get this:

ames: czar zod.urbit.org: ip .104.197.214.171
ames: on localhost, UDP 55670.
http: live (insecure, public) on 8080
http: live ("secure", public) on 8443
http: live (insecure, loopback) on 12321
; ~zod not responding still trying
; ~zod is ok
; ~zod is your neighbor
<awaiting hood, this may take a few minutes>


It's been like this for over 20 minutes.

What should I do?
