`%ford` runes generally don't work in libraries (files in the `lib` directory), which is why `uppers` is not showing up in the subject when your code is in a library. This is not how it should work, but it is currently the case.

As for marks vs. renderers, I don't think you should need a renderer; a mark will do just fine. The main difference between a mark and a renderer is that a mark isn't aware of a path; it just takes a binary blob as input and outputs a typed hoon data structure. A renderer, on the other hand, is path-aware: a renderer is run with a concept of "current path." This allows the rendered to do things like pull in all the markdown files under the current path, and render them all inside an HTML page.

A mark can use `%ford` runes internally, so it can reference other files. It just can't have its "current path" changed when being rendered.

I think we'll want to redesign the renderer system relatively soon, along with the `tree` web publishing engine.

Does that answer your questions?
