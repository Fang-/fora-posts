## `~rovnys-ricfer`
Expanding on ~ridsef's explanation (I *think* this is how it works):
Events involving communication with other urbits have sequence numbers, so if you forget those events and then try to talk to another urbit, the other urbit will think you're trying to re-send a past message and ignore you, and when they try to talk to you, your urbit will think it's receiving messages from the future -- urbit may be an ambitious project, but the [tachyonic antitelephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyonic_antitelephone) is out-of-scope for cc-release. If an urbit does lose this sort of information, it's said to have "brain damage" and is generally unable to continue participation in the network.

That being said, in addition to the nuclear option that ~ravmel mentioned (which I believe would need the other urbits to reset their sequence numbers for communicating with you), I think it should also be possible to build a feature that allows you to conveniently wipe the non-continuity-breaching parts of your arvo state.

There should also be a way to reset the dojo subject, which is stateful. I bet ~pittyp or ~tonlur knows a way to do that (and I'd like to know too).
