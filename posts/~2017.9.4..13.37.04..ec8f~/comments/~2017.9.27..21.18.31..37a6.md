hmmm so what happens when the VPS I'm hosting this ship on restarts and I'm re-launching the ship instantly? This is what has happened quite a few times. I seem to be able to just run my ship with no problem.

I'd want to shutdown my ship then try "launching" my backup just to check what happens, but now I'm scared of inflicting brain damage to urbit! ;P
