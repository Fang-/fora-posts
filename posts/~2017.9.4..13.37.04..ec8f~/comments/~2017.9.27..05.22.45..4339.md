~sigmes Well, you seemed to be able to post this from a planet, but maybe that's just your cookie still laying around.

In either case, we're happy to give you another planet. But generally speaking, in this era, if you lose/delete your pier (ships folder), you lose your ship. So keep it safe!

Of course, we'll be breaching for cc-release soon. So you'll be able to boot a fresh pier from your original ticket.
