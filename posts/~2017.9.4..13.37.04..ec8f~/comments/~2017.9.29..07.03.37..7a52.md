right now, I run all my ships on vps's and keep them on all the time. the only thing i do to avoid brain damage is develop on fakezods instead of my real ship in the cloud.

i wouldn't worry too much. this is a testnet, there's a procedure for rekeying on cc-release, and the long term plan is to use a replicated event log like apache kafka so loss of a single vps instance won't hose your urbits.
