To add to that: most lists *are* pairs!

The only kind of list that isn't a pair is the empty list: `~`.  If the list isn't empty, then it's a pair in which the left is the first member of the list, and the right is the rest of the list.  The following is over-simplified, but say you have the following "list":

`[1 2 3 4 5 6 ~]`

This list is a pair, the left of which is `1`.  The right of the pair is everything else, which is also a list:

`[2 3 4 5 6 ~]`

This list is also a pair, the left of which is `2`, the right of which is the following list:

`[3 4 5 6 ~]`

...and so on...
