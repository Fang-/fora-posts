For a concrete illustration of the above post, take udon for example. 
I don't plan to roll my own markdown in any future Urbit application, because I find udon to be _very useful_. The interface is clear, the integration with the rest of Urbit is good.
So it has become the standard "aqueduct", by virtue of its usability, rather than by proclamation.

If tomorrow we have the equivalent aqueduct for UI, and it will be really useful and better than `elm-urbit`, judged by the usual criteria of ease of development, lack of introduced bugs, type safety, time efficiency and so on, I will switch in the heartbeat to using it. 

I don't think martians are this kind of folk which are religiously attached to tools - we use the best tool for the job. So if next year Urbit will get standard way to build UI which will be superior to what Plato is build on right now, all the better. After all our goal is Urbit itself, not shovels used to build it :-)
