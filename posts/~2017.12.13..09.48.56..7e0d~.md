Fellow Martians.
Star Dukes.
Galactic Senators. 

I would like to request comments and ideas on the new online Urbit IDE: Plato. 
Plato is currently in a front-end development phase, and has been rewritten in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/)

Below is preliminary look at the interface (pay less attention to style. Can be changed)
[Interface](http://i.magaimg.net/img/23k5.png)

The preliminary beta version of plato will include following functions:
- Nock/Hoon modes
- In-editor execution (output to the Terminal pane)

In the next phase we plan to implement 
the "Resources" pane functionality. 
Basically, Plato will hook into Clay (requiring plato daemon to be running)
to enable integration with Urbit's storage.

In the long term some form of code sharing will be implemented.
I am not sure if it is possible to merge/sync single clay nodes?

Anyway, I am very excited for this project, and I am sure you also are ;-)

I will appreciate any comments, requests etc. 

Plato being written in Elm, it will also be necessary 
to write Urb.elm in place of Urb.elm (though to get quick we could just use ports feature of Elm. Ports are a way to interact with JS in a typesafe manner)
