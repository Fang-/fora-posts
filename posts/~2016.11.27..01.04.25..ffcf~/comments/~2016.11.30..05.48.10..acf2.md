## `~master-morzod`
First, let me echo the other comments: this is awesome work! (and, like the others, I'd love to poke around at the source at some point)

I don't have any particular objections to 256-color support -- it'd complicate some types and interfaces, but there's no question that it'd be *fun*.

The actual ANSI-code implementation in `dill` wouldn't need to change much. I guess that vere would send a new `++dill-belt` containing the equivalent of `$(tput colors)` on startup, but I don't think setaf/setab are necessary. `++tint` would need to be wrapped in something like `$@(tint (pair tint @ud))` (one of `?($~ $r $g $b $c $m $y $k $w)`, or a pair of that (as fallback) plus an xterm color number). There could be a library for matching names to color codes, but it seems like overkill to put the actual names in the kernel. And I think there's a lot of interest in running urbit in unusual or constrained environments, so vere should probably have a commandline flag to disable advanced colors.

That's how i'd do it, off the top of my head, anyway. Anybody see some kind of downside that I'm missing?
