## `~sorreg-namtyv`
Above I meant `[result new-core]`, of course.

Also, I know the doc (let alone the emacs mode) is not great.  But it would be super useful to hear in a little more detail what the worst pain points were.

That's a good idea -- I've thought of adding a rune for the `=.(wing ?=([condition] a [alternative]))` pattern.  The repetition is clumsy and irritating.  It's not a big thing but it's a thing.  Try adding one to hoon.hoon!  You may find it's easier than you expect...
