## `~ponnys-podfer`
In addition to the points ~palfun raised:

* Accessing the docs is really slow. Navigation between pages is a multi-second operation. I'm not sure where the latency is--I assume somewhere on the Urbit side of things since I believe you self-host.

* And because the paths for the twig references now have both the rune and the string name in them, even if I know that I want to see the docs on tisfas, I can't just change the URL to /tis/fas/. So I'll often have to navigate two levels up from the twig reference page I'm looking at, and then down two. Four navigations, where each navigation is slow compounds things.

* I've found that the section numbering/ordering in the library reference is usually wrong. Since Curtis upthread mentioned maybe adding a macro for the conditional tisdot, I had hoon.hoon open to section 2fB, macro expansion. Let's look that up in the docs. [Section 2f][2f] is...noun ordering. Entirely different. Searching for title, it looks like its [section 5b][5b]. (Incidentally, this leads to an entirely blank page; not even XXX messages.) It also looks like the cc-release branch changes all of this again.
