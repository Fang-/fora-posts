**First of all:**

Let's figure out a way to get people together here at the Tlon office to talk more about this.  I think that'd be a lot of fun, and we'd be glad to host.  `~ponnys-podfer`, can you send an email to `galen@tlon.io` and we'll set something up?

**Second: **

The feedback about documentation is really good.  Everyone here is a so wrapped up in making things work that we really neglect to make the learning path better.  Discoverability is truly a  mess.  If anyone is willing to work on fixing that problem we would be **very** happy to help.  We'll definitely need to improve this area significantly now that `zuse` is being restructured.  (The restructuring itself actually makes it much more readable on its own, I think).

This is also true for improving the writing and overall clarity.  PRs are welcome, or perhaps we should just start a separate thread to discuss improvements that can be made.
