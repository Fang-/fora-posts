But this is all boring next to your most interesting question: the right way to build a decentralized MUD on Urbit.

There's an interesting relationship to the "spatial OS" that Improbable is building.  Of course a MUD, at least a traditional MUD, is not organized as a dimensioned space.  But the basic problem of "who handles the framework of reality" remains.

Ultimately this is dictated by things like game logic.  For instance, it seems straightforward that my urbit is my room, and anyone who comes in my room is a guest who logs in with his urbit.  Of course my estate might be a whole castle, not just a room, but I should manage my own castle.

But what about objects?  If I can just show up on your urbit and declare what objects I have, and on your urbit I have them, that might suit one form of MUD but not others.  Are objects scarce?  If so, perhaps they need to be minted by some third party, "central" or otherwise -- which might even track their current location...
