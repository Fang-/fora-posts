All,

I've been writing a Tumblr connector, and I've run into some difficulties.

Code is here:
https://github.com/vvisigoth/tumblr-urbit-api

If I run:

`.^(arch %gx /=tumblr=/user/info/json)`, which I'd expect to just dump out the json from the response (it's connecting fine), I get this error
```
[ %ford-syve-lost
  /gx/~palhec-mocseb-bonlut-narnes--mapbus-rolmyr-nocsul-norben/tumblr/~2017.7.27..17.02.41..8406/user/info/json
  want=#t/{fil/u(@uvI) dir/nlr({p/@ta q/$~})}
  have=#t/^#1.?($~ {$a p/it(#1)} {$b p/?($.y $.n)} {$n p/@ta} {$o p/nlr({p/@t q/#1})} {$s p/@t})
]
```
If I run:
`.^(arch %gx /=tumblr=/user/info/user-info)` which I'd expect to get stuff from API and then convert to user-info mark, I get the following:
```
/~palhec-mocseb-bonlut-narnes--mapbus-rolmyr-nocsul-norben/home/0/mar/tumblr/user-info:<[12 5].[14 33]>
/~palhec-mocseb-bonlut-narnes--mapbus-rolmyr-nocsul-norben/home/0/mar/tumblr/user-info:<[13 5].[14 33]>
%need
ford: casting %json to %tumblr-user-info
ford: cast %tumblr-user-info
ford-scry-made-fail
```
This makes me believe that 1) parsing is failing and 2) I'm not properly unitted. The latter I can't find for the life of me.

Can any of you kind-hearted martians take a look at this and lend a hand?
