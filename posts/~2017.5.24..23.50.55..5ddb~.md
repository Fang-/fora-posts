Well, more precisely: Tlon, Urbit's sponsor, is hiring.

On the back end, we're looking for talented systems programmers, period.  Happy to talk to anyone at any career stage -- from new grads to managers.  A strong background in runtime systems, compiler implementation, kernels, databases, distributed systems, blockchain/crypto, and/or FP is great.

On the front end, we're looking for a multi-talented unicorn who writes clean ES6, can build frameworks as well as use them, and cares about user experience.  You donâ€™t have to be a designer, but you should be able to build a grid system in CSS.

We're in the Mission, SF, near some of the world's best burritos.  Tlon is an equal-opportunity employer and believes in work-life balance.  Our office has a fig tree and lots of books.  Send resumes to galen at tlon.io.
