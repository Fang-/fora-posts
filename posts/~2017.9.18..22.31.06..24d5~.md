This should probably be in the docs somewhere too, but until then, here's a [hoon cheat sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OiPaW187NHFMGaSprAl-Ed3_r7NyeZfqgOoB9s_fFik/edit?usp=sharing).

It's missing a few of the literal syntaxes (hoon is rather spectacularly baroque with its literals), but covers the most common ones. This also does not list any of the `%ford` runes, although there is now at least some documentation for those [here](https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/ford/runes.md). 

The following runes also exist, but are currently undocumented and not listed in the cheat sheet:
```
!.  ::  turn on debugging printfs
!:  ::  turn off debugging printfs
!;  ::  using the "type of type", emit the type for an expression (I don't really get this one)
!,  ::  emit AST of expression
$*  ::  bunt (irregular form is *)
^.  ::  use gate to transform type
^&  ::  zinc (covariant) -- see the docs on advanced types
```
