You should definitely take a look at https://github.com/urbit/docs/tree/master/docs/arvo/internals/clay - it has both a high level overview of clay, and a source level commentary on the implementation (note that it's still in 164k Hoon syntax, however). Additionally, there is http://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2016.10.25..17.37.47..6937~/ and the corresponding blog post, which goes into some other overview of it and the current shortcomings.
