~ponnys, I don't think %gall keeps any historical app state. I don't know it very well, but just tracing through, `++scry` calls `++mo-peek` calls `++ap-peek`, which actually pulls the `++peek` arm from your app. There's some validation of the parsed beak in `++scry`, but everything else appears to just use the path.

And since `++peek` is just a gate that interprets the request path, %gall would have to keep every historical version of your whole app core, which might include old versions of the kernel. So that would be totally unworkable.

But if there were some type of standardized query of the only the app state (like an XPath expression), I think what you're describing could work. You'd need a generic tree differencing engine (or you'd have to write the equivalent of a mark for your app state). But that would be very cool ...
