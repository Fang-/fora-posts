~digser: The first thing in your `%gall` scry paths appears to be a `++beak`, so I assume that I can refer to past app state when I'm scrying. If that's correct, that's pretty neat.

I assume then that there's some sort of diffing and only storing diffs internally for past app state that gets reconstituted if I refer to old state? Or would this store the whole state each invocation?
