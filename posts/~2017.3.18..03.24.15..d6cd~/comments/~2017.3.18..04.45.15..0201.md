This is great! Let me add `spiel`, `spout` and `crow` to the name pile. (I haven't yet decided if those are meant ironically ...)

Could this be made to work by simply providing a namespace for `:talk`? (`++peek`/`++peer-scry` for `.^`/`:wish` ...) I haven't tried to dereference app namespaces via %eyre, and I don't know if it works now, but it seems like it should.

Is that the %gall code that you linked?
