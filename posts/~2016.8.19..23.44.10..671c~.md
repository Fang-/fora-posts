From earlier discussion on urbit-meta, it sounds as though urbit piers cannot be backed up online.  That's because if the urbits keep running (and later crash), the backups cannot be used to restart a clone urbit (because e.g. the backup will have missed events that cannot be resent and thus state made consistent).

What are the plans, if any, for letting urbits be backed up, for disaster recovery purposes?
