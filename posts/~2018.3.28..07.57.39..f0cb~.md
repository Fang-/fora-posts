Short conversation from `/urbit-meta` worth saving:

```
~nolmeg-hodbyn+ what does the =, rune do?
~davtyr-nimren+ not sure of the exact semantics but basically it allows you to
                "import" the arms of some core into your current environment
~davtyr-nimren+ say you have a core named "foo" with an arm "bar"
~davtyr-nimren+ normally you would have to do bar:foo to access it
~davtyr-nimren+ but if you do =,  foo, you can access it with just bar
```

For those who didn't know, which included me until just now.
