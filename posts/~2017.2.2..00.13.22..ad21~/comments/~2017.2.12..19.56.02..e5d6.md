Somehow I still haven't managed to get [this](https://github.com/Fang-/arvo/blob/talk-polls/app/talk.hoon#L1241) to work right (as in, not result in a drum-coup-fail). The pokes are still not sending to remote ships either, only to our.  
I'm assuming that what I'm trying to do is not impossible. Hell, I thought I had an understanding of how this worked/was supposed to work, but I guess that's not the case. I trial-and-errored everything I could think of, but it's errors all the way down.

This is blocking me. There's still some tidying up to be done, and a few open todo's still, but as far as functionality goes I really want to be able to successfully test this.
