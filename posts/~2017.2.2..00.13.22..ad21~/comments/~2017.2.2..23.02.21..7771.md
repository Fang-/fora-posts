## `~palfun-foslup`
Okay then, assuming all my comments in this are correct, why does this nest-fail?  
If I can get the below code working, I *think* I should be able to `ra-abet:(ra-poll:ra args)` in a poke arm to get a list of moves and new state, which I can produce to apply all my changes/actions?

```
  ++  ra-poll
    |=  {id/@ud stat/station}
    ^+  +>  ::  cast by example of our context, the ++ra core
    ::  this call nest-fails, even though it produces something that fits our cast, right?
    %^  ra-consume  &  stat
    :+  (shaf %poll eny.hid)
        (my [[%& stat] *envelope %pending] ~)
        :+  now.hid
            (sy /poll ~)
            [%non ~]  ::  tmp, simplest msg type

  ++  ra-consume                                        ::  consume thought
    |=  {pub/? her/ship tip/thought}
    =.  tip  (ra-normal tip)
    =+  aud=(~(tap by q.tip) ~)
    |-  ^+  +>.^$  ::  cast by example of our core's (|='s) context, the ++ra core
    ?~  aud  +>.^$
    $(aud t.aud, +>.^$ (ra-conduct pub her p.i.aud tip))
```
