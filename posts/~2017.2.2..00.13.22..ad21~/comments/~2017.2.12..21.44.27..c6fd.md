This sucks.  

I would want to help you, but it's basically going too deep into pre-master systems I'm not super confident about already.  There are a lot of different brittlenesses along the network poke path, some quite difficult to eradicate incrementally.   I'm not convinced I could do much better than you here, and I think my time is better spent on building something I can debug.

If you want to understand the problem more closely, which would certainly be useful and educational, that's going to involve descending into %gall and debugging the vane itself.  This used to be one of our highest quality vanes, which makes me shudder, but it's still not *all* that bad.
