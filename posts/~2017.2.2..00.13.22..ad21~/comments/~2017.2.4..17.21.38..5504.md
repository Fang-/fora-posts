A couple things jump out:

-  `++poke` arms are overloaded by *mark*, not *wire*
- the `%drum-coup-fail` noun is a `$det` sole-effect -- you must not be processing console edits correctly. This kind of thing happens when the vector-clock gets out of sync.

I'll look closer at this items and the app source if I can find some time later ...
