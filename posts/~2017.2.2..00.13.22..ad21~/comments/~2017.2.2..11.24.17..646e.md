Maybe you've never seen these nested core machines before -- we use them a lot in our more complicated systems.

The general idea is that, in "normal" object-oriented languages, we keep our code and our data joined at the hip.  This makes it tough to do urbity things like changing the code in living data.

In Urbit we keep the data in a pure data structure, and create a core while we're working on it.  A common pattern is that the core, like ++ra, contains both the data we're working on and the effects we're trying to produce.

Within the core, it's very common to see "monadic" (basically a State monad, please don't go and learn this stuff if you don't know it, I don't) products that look like `[something _+>]`, meaning that you're producing a cell of something and this core.  Basically the equivalent of an imperative "function" that produces a new result and a new world state.  `=^` is highly useful in wrangling.

When we're done with the core, we "abet" it (just a canonical name), often by reinstalling some noun in a central map, and sending the effects off to be executed.  It's all purely functional, but it mimics imperative programming.

Does this answer your question?
