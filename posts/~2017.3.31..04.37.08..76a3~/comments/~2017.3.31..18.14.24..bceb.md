Urbit should be crash safe, and I press ^Z if dojo is spinning printing a core all the time, so it's kinda weird it corrupted for you. But yeah. Log is being rewritten for next update, everything will be perfect and pure or something.

It does look like you're using the -D flag, though, which I'm pretty sure doesn't actually work. So that might part of it.
