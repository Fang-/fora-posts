I don't think I agree with this. It's a lot of complexity and mechanation for the goals for ideological purity and functionality that no one would really use. The date beak in scrys is so that all Hoon and Nock code is referentially transparent, not so that you can feasibly ask for data from any time period. I don't even think the rest of our vanes follow that model; Ames keeps a key and packet log because it's Ames, but stuff like asking for /=pals= from a day ago I wouldn't expect to be correct if it wasn't cached at that point already.
