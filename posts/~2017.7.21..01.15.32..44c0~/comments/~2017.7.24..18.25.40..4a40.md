## `~mastyr-harlud`
Adding to that idea ~poldec, just like how urbits can send BTC to others via ship name or BTC address in the new (unpublished) demo of Urbit, you should also be able to send a DM to either another urbit (in which case `:twit` uses that ship's corresponding Twitter account) *or* an explicit Twitter handle. Hmm, it's like there's some underlying... *pattern*... ^chuckle.
