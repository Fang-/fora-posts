At the core, there is a [known vere issue](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/784) causing network errors to put the per-API queue of outbound http requests on pause.

We'll fix this soon, but for now, you can work around this by editing the `eyre.hoon` vane in your ship's `arvo` directory (in your `/=home=` desk, which you might need to `|mount`).

Just replace the `?.  liv` line according to the diff below:

```
diff --git i/arvo/eyre.hoon w/arvo/eyre.hoon
index bfaf8b3..7f455de 100644
