Hotfix is live, please |unlink %talk and then |link %talk. Sorry if this triggers any ames bugs on moons - the only solace is that you probably have more moons. There's talk of remotely unlinking and linking the talk app of those who don't read this message, but you don't need to wait to get back into a working state.
