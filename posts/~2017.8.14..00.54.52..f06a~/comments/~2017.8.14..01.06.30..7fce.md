Two more notes:

Updates seem to have been sent over the network, so web talk is fixed and step 2 of the setup has already been done for you.

Also, to prevent clock-sync issues, the app looks at other people's web.plan files as they were five minutes in the past. So it'll take five minutes after adding your address to web.plan before other people will be able to transfer to that using your ship name.
