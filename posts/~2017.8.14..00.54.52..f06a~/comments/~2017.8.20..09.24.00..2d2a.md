Yep, it's been [fixed](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/355) for a while now.  
You're completely right that a malevolent chat host could mess with this. I initially had the idea of requiring users to type "y" or something into the app to approve of talk transactions, but that fell out of scope/time, and seemed to go against the point of easily being able to send tips. There's probably cooler solutions to be found here.

There's enough metadata available in talk to query for all sent messages, so that might be good to put in as a hook. Good idea, thank you!
