Thoughts on creating and defaulting a `master-discouragement` branch

Containing only a README of
```
Urbit does not subscribe to the "working build" github flow.

If you want to install urbit, [download an official release](/install);
if you are a package maintainer, package a `maint-*` branch;
and if you wish to develop on urbit, checkout `master` and follow the instructions there.
```

so people don't get confused?
