I agree that we should update the `README` to be a bit clearer, but I don't know about a `master-discouragement` branch.  

I'm still sort of mulling over whether it's better to have GH default to a maintenance branch that may or may not work.  The `README` should  be updated regardless.

It's on my list of things to do — I'll submit a PR.
