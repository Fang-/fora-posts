`~lidtud` Huh, well if this is the case, you must have already tried to boot your planet once before in this era. Urbit's networking is stateful, so once you boot a planet, you can't boot it a second time. Furthermore, if you lost or deleted that planet's pier, I'm afraid you've lost that planet for this continuity era[1]. In the future, we're planning to implement a feature which will allow you to reset your planet given that you own and can provide that planet's private key.

For now, you can boot a comet or a second planet from scratch, until we breach the next time in the coming year, upon which you can choose which of your two planet identities you would like to continue going forward with. We know, losing your planet is potentially emotionally scarring (we all bond with our planets very deeply), but this is the best we can do.

Reach out to me by email (<keaton@tlon.io>), and I can send you an invite for another planet, which you can boot per the normal install instructions.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any more questions.
