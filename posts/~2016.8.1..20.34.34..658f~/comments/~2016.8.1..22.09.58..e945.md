## `~raplys-lornex`
Are the circumstances that require a trailing ~ after post times in scope here? For background, eyre (or something) sees a URL ending in something like `.658f`, thinks it's an extension. and tries to render the (nonexistent) path `~2016.8.1..20.34.34.` with the (nonexistent) mark `658f`. I think a pragmatic solution where we check the existence of the path first literally and then with extension-as-mark will handle all real-world cases, and we can puzzle out a perfect embedding at our leisure.
