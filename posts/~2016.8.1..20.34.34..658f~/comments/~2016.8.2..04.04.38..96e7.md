`~torbyt`, I'd happily support someone who wanted to work on theming.  The first part is just refactoring the css.  I wrote a lot of the css â€” but I think it kind of sucks.  I'm just not the greatest css guy in the world.

In a way, `:tree` is a theme.  It's all built on top of bootstrap.  If you (or someone else) is up for taking this on, I think that's great.
