I have to agree, adding more irregular syntax is one of those "now you have two problems" things. Visually it isn't bad, especially if it's possible to use -.val, and the correct way to approach this for newbies is to teach /why/ you have to use {$val *} (especially since nearly all mainstream languages don't have pattern matching)
