My view is that this, if anything, makes the case for *removing* `tag+value`. These weird syntaxes to save tiny, tiny bits of horizontal space in a language whose overall syntactic design lets it use vertical space uniquely well don't sit right with me. We shouldn't be using enough horizontal space that these sorts of penny-pinching syntaxes even matter, and they have to live rent-free in the minds of everyone who ever has to read Hoon code for any reason. Furthermore, even the ones that do pay rent seem to be used for awful obfuscatory golfing in practice - the same awful obfuscatory golfing that should never be necessary in Hoon, which can make comfortable use of vertical space.

No postfix syntaxes, please!
