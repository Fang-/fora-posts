I did a video screencast this morning with my good friend Jordan Leigh (web handle: *alwaysbcoding*). Jordan's an OG Web-3.0 fanatic and longtime Urbit fan. We originally did a video last November, almost a year ago (wow, time flies) when I was just starting out my Urbit journey. Fair to say, neither of us knew what we were talking about at all. So we wanted to try this again, a Part 2 of sorts. We think you'll enjoy it!

The original plan was to walk through the *Feed* Twitter clone example, some intro Nock and Hoon and end trying to roll our own mini-Twitter Gall app (not relying on Talk as the backend). Instead, we ended up talking deeply for two hours about the Urbit system as a whole and the application model. I think this can act as a great overview for anyone technical who's brand new to Urbit and wants to see visually how to get set up for the first time. Part 3, where we'll actually build stuff, should be even better!

I'd love to hear your feedback in the comments below. Please be harsh! We at Tlon want to nail down a great format for our own in-house video series that we'll be starting soon. Urbit is in fact simple, and we know it can be taught.
