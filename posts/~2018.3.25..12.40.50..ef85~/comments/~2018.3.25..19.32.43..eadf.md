Nice to hear that, ~poldec ;-)

A side note: I have decided to pull the plug on Github, and keep only the code there. Actualy development will be happening on plato-install webpage, until we grow enough to move issues into fora. 

There is a dedicated development channel `~ponmep-litsem/plato-dev`, feel free to join for collaboration and announcements.

This is in spirit of The Homecoming: Plato being non-critical component does not sophisticated mechanism of Github and fora/channels are a good replacement for rather small projects collaborations.
