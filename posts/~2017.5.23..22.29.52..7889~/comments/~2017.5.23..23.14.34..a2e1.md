## `~lapfel-samlun`
It is a common misunderstanding that this channel is something like a taunt, a sort of modern form of the Spartans' "come and take". In fact, on topic discussion for this channel is restricted to anti-littering measures to be taken in the event of a TX meetup, and meta discussions about the channel's name.
