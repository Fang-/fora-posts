I'm closer to the east than west coast, but still an ocean's width away. That said, good initiative!

As for your motivation struggles, maybe it'd be fun to do consistent weekly/monthly checkins with the whole community to share what we're working on/thinking about? Workgroup Wednesdays or something, using fora for long-form show-and-tell, and a dedicated chat channel to facilitate tighter communication.

Idk though, just a thought.
