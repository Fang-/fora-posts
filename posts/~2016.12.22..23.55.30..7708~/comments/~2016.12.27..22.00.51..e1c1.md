I know there are at least a few Urbits on the East coast.  I even heard about a meetup after it had happened at one point.  Unfortunately, we do a pretty bad job of making community information discoverable.  I'll tweet this thread, and maybe that will attract some more attention.

The idea of a weekly meeting on Urbit itself makes a lot of sense.  We used to do something like this, but it slowly lost steam.  I'd be happy to bring that back.
