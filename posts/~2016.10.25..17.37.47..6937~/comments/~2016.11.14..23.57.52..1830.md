#### merges and rebases

I don't think there's as big a problem here as you think.

One thing to remember is that the immutable, numbered version history and the ancestry graph are *different things*.  Yes, in the common case, the single parent of version 98 is version 97.  But version 98 could have two mommies, and maybe one of its mommies isn't even a real version.

Suppose version 97 is the result of a series of single-parent commits starting from version 90.  But we actually want to rebase and make it 3 clean commits.  No problem.  Either you want all commits to have real versions (in which case we're creating versions 98, 99 and 100), or we're creating version 98 with two anonymous parents, then version 90.  Either way, 91 through 97 are orphaned in a sense -- git would garbage-collect them, we probably won't.
