Lots of interesting thoughts here!  Let me try to get them in some kind of order.

### `HEAD`

As Anton has already noted, the concept of a mutable reference like HEAD is fundamentally inimical to Urbity immutability.  If you want local consistency beyond the current event, use `%cw` to get the version at `(scot %da now)`, and work from that number.

### Unix

I understand the concern with removing features.  I guess I would say the goal is to remove not the feature, but the need for the feature.

Basically at the Unix level it's just weird to have a daemon writing to your files spontaneously.  Unix does not really handle the multiple-writers case well.  Don't use an OS to do weird shit it's not designed to do, even if it should be designed to do it.

Therefore, the right way to edit an Urbit desk from Unix is to work in an editing desk branched out from the target desk.  The editing deck is locked to a single input source (the Unix filesystem watcher).  And all serious revision-control operations are within Urbit.

Okay, you might want to update your editing desk from the target desk.  But one, this is disapproved of by our best revision-control experts.  And two, it can be done when the Unix tree is perfectly synced to the Urbit editing desk, making the update a pure overwrite, not a merge.

To be continued...
