You mention how we're using git because clay lacks some important UI. One common git action in my flow at least is "checkout different branch while keeping my uncommited changes": perhaps I made some minor fix that doesn't belong on the project branch, and want to `checkout -b minorfix master; commit; pull-request; checkout -`. Or if the relevant file has changed, `stash; checkout -b minorfix master; stash apply; ...`. This kind of trivial rebasing sounds like it would get painful on a 1-1 directory mapping; thoughts on what a usable console UI would look like?
