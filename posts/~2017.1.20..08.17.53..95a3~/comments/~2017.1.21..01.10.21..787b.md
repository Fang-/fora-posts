I find several things still mysterious about this.  What exactly is the [branch-name:%d] convention?  What is the number and what does it mean?  In which commit messages do you put it?  I can guess at what you mean here, but I might well be wrong.

We have multiple interlocking dependency issues.  Dependencies between vere and arvo are completely separate from dependencies between versions of arvo.  In almost all cases it is *not* necessary to compile a version of arvo with a pill built from the exact previous git commit.  In other cases it is necessary.  Finally, there are of course dependencies between hoon.hoon/zuse/arvo/vanes and application-level code.
 
I think the error in our approach is broader.  These dependencies should not be implicit.  They should not require embedding in git metadata, which isn't even native to Urbit.  They should be tracked and enforced by Urbit itself.  Once we've addressed this problem natively, we can worry about how to translate these dependencies and declarations into the language of git.

But using git to encode them, and crashing if we make a git handling error (which is what we do now), doesn't cut it.
