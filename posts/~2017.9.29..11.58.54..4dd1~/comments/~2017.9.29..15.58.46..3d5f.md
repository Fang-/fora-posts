Hmm... not sure why that last comment didn't show up a me, pretty sure I was logged in.

~rovbus : Here's how I use it for that scenario. I have my blog's source in github. i have it checked out to my amazon-hosted urbit. i work on the post locally (also using syncing to my local fake-zod to see changes) and when its ready i commit and push it to GH. with urbit-sync running in the background on my urbit, I just pull the changes to the checked out repo and they are copied over to my pier. 

I intend to add polling and git pulling into urbit-sync real-soon (tm).
