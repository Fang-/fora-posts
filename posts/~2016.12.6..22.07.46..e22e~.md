Here’s the deal:

The TL;DR is: don’t expect code from `master` to run on the live network.  We’ll keep maintenance branches for each continuity era, like `maint-0.4`.  If you’re wondering where to submit a PR, just ask us.  The answer is probably `master`.  Don’t worry about any open PRs you may have — we’ll figure out how to get them into the right place.  

The longer explanation is: we’re going to actually distribute tagged releases.  Each release will have its own maintenance branch after it’s released, and the network will be running the HEAD of one of those maintenance branches.  `master` will be the main place for future development work, and may not be compatible with what we’re running on the network.  

If you’re not doing development work, just use the tagged releases either by downloading the source `.tar`, or from a package manager.  The repo is really just for development going forward.

The switch is actually already complete.  We’re still processing some PRs.  Expect Urbit 0.4.1 on Friday, December 9th.  It’s basically just 0.4 with a few tweaks.
