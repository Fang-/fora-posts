Lightly edited for clarity:

```
~taglux-nidsep+ finding the axis of map values makes no sense to me
~taglux-nidsep+ the products i'm getting aren't intuitive
~taglux-nidsep+ so for this map:
~taglux-nidsep+ {[p='wash' q=2] [p='kaylee' q=3] [p='mal' q=4] [p='summer' q=1]}
~taglux-nidsep+ when that map is stored in 'n' and i run:

~taglux-nidsep+ (~(dig by n) 'summer')
~taglux-nidsep+ the product is [~ 254]
~taglux-nidsep+ why 254?

~taglux-nidsep+ i get that it's consistent and it works
~taglux-nidsep+ i don't get how the underlying tree looks
~littel-ponnys+ oh, it looks like a treap
~littel-ponnys+ (don't worry, curtis had to explain this to me, too.)
~littel-ponnys+ so you want your data as a binary tree

~taglux-nidsep+ yeah...
~littel-ponnys+ since binary trees are all that nock has
~littel-ponnys+ but there's going to be regularity in most keys
~littel-ponnys+ so if you do naive sorting on keys, you're going to get badly 
~littel-ponnys+ unbalanced binary trees

~taglux-nidsep+ makes sense
~littel-ponnys+ so what you do instead is hash all the keys (twice)
~littel-ponnys+ and then use those unpredictable hashes as a sort of 
~littel-ponnys+ deterministic entropy
~taglux-nidsep+ ah

~littel-ponnys+ ("deterministic entropy")
~taglux-nidsep+ and this helps performance of tree searches?
~littel-ponnys+ so then you do heap ordering on these hash values
~taglux-nidsep+ since there'd be some balancing?
~littel-ponnys+ yes. since hash functions are (hopefully) evenly distributed.

~littel-ponnys+ then it's just the heap algorithm
~littel-ponnys+ the average case of searching in a balanced binary tree is o(log
~littel-ponnys+ n)
~littel-ponnys+ but a fully unbalanced tree is o(n)
~littel-ponnys+ this is why making sure the tree is balanced is so important

~taglux-nidsep+ that's not so bad
~littel-ponnys+ it does have trade offs!
~littel-ponnys+ iterating over your map is no longer in key order
