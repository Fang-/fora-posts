As a semi-aside: How are other Urbiters on Debian-based Linux distros keeping themselves up-to-date? Right now I'm keeping track of my installed Urbit version manually and periodically checking for new ones to install over. As far as I know, this is the only way to do it with third-party packages which aren't from PPAs, but maybe I'm missing something obvious (or some non-obvious Debian-fu).
