Merry Christmas!  Ohio is very cold and full of nasty diseases.  Sorry, Ohio.

This winter is going to be a winter of docs.  We are going to rewrite them over and over again, like the rest of Urbit, until we get them right.

The mold content here is especially good -- I may adapt a bunch of it for the next Urbyte.  It's incredibly valuable to have someone who isn't me writing language docs, because you catch all the blind spots.  I remain resolutely convinced that Hoon is a very simple language :-/
