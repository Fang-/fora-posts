## `~tonlur-sarret`
I've tried a bunch of one-liners:

* "Urbit is a network of personal servers."
* "Urbit is a social network of computers."
* "Urbit is rebuilding the Web from scratch."
* ...

Honestly, I haven't had much success with any of them. 

`~ravmel`'s approach is interesting to me and seems to reflect my personal experience. I get way farther with people when I explain the core idea of Urbit on a personal level as it relates to how they personally compute today. And that makes a lot of sense to me. We're designing Urbit to be personal. We should market it that way.
