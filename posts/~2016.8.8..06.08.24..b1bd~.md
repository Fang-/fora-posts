I've been messing around with `%eyre` over the weekend, building a small [library](https://github.com/dclelland/Ursus) which can talk to its HTTP/JSON interface from inside an iOS application. I guess it's meant to be like a Swift equivalent of `urb.js`? Gotta start somewhere I guess.

If you have Xcode 7 there's a demo application in the repository. So far I've got [authentication](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/#-1-3-authentication) and [messaging](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/#-1-4-messaging) up and running. Next I think I'm going to look at the [long-polling](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/specification/#-1-5-subscriptions) interface.

While playing around with the API I ran across a few quirks I didn't quite understand:

- The `?METHOD` query string on the end of some requests, e.g. `/~/auth.json?PUT`, when you're really making a `POST` request. Is this perhaps just a case of `%eyre` being a WIP?
- The `{"ok": true}` or `{"fail": ...}` responses, are these a standard thing? I've really only been playing around with `%examples-click` so far but I'd like to start branching out from there...

Anyhow, just wanted to share what I've been working on.
