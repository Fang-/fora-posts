## `~tonlur-sarret`
More specifically ~mittyr, the issue is with the caching and dependency-tracking system in Ford, Urbit's functional reactive build system. The problem manifests in Fora specifically. First, someone creates a new post, or comments on an existing post. Ford recognizes that the dependencies for the build changed, which affects everywhere on Fora where there is a sidebar list of titles, for example. Ford then rebuilds all of Fora in response to this. So 80% of the time when you're trying to load Fora, it blocks on you because Ford is rebuilding all of it.

We're actively working on a few Ford caching and dependency-tracking system, documented in [this Urbit Proposal (UP)](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.10.19..04.47.50..c107~) (if it can even load for you). It's one of our top priorities right now to improve web performance. It's obviously a requirement for a great Urbit user experience.

The work that `~davtyr-nimren` (`@ixv` on Github) is doing on static publishing via server-side rendering will seriously help alleviate this too, in conjunction with the above Ford solution. We mentioned this briefly in our last two quick updates: [`~2017.12.1`](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.12.2..01.49.08..6900~/), [`~2017.12.15`](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.12.16..01.42.49..1a94~/).

Thanks for being patient while we work on all this. Let us know if you have any more questions.
