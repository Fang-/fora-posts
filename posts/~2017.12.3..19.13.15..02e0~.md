There is a new blog post at urbitetorbi.org 
No doubtly some of our fellow martians you lost their planets in an interplanetary incident.
The good news, I managed to recover at least two planets with this easy method: [http://urbitetorbi.org/urbit/general/2017/12/03/planet-crash-recovery.html](http://urbitetorbi.org/urbit/general/2017/12/03/planet-crash-recovery.html)

Let me know if it works for someone. 

Best,
