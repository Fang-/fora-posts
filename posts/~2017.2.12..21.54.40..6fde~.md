I've revived my old hidduc tutorials. http://fosnut-dandut.urbit.org/pages/hidducs-notes/tutorial

They take a slightly different approach from the official tutes and may be slightly out of date in places. However they are guaranteed to be "correct" in the "it compiles" sense largely due to the showcode functionality in the lib.

You can find that code here:https://bitbucket.org/zaphar/hoon-intro/src/default/lib/hidducs-notes/lib.hoon feel free to steal anything from that repository. If you find something that is no longer correct or subtly wrong feel free to send a pull request with the fix as well.
