~tonlur you are my hero!!!

I had realized that there was no noun.hoon in /mar, but I didn't quite have the hang of making mark files.  But I figured since I was able to use the noun mark when I stayed on the same ship, it would be okay regardless.

Are the mark files in /mar only used for passing messages to other ships?
