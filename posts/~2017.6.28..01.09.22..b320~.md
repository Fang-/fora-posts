All,
I have completed the arduous task of rewriting my ghetto trello app (taskk) in React+Redux; I have many insights and learnings to share. But in the short-term, a practical question.

Where would be the most appropriate place in /web to host this baby? I tried to put an index.html in a directory in /pages and urbit borked, presumably looking for sail. Where is the best place to just put some html and have it just do html-y things (in this case, collect all of my js magic)?
