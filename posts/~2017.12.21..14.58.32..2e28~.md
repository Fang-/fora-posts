I followed https://urbit.org/docs/using/install/ in an attempt to install post-dec7 urbit-0.5.1

Problem is it hangs forever, I let it run overnight and it never finishes booting

```
urbit (master)$ urbit litnyr-mostes
~
urbit 0.4.5
urbit: home is litnyr-mostes
loom: mapped 2048MB
protected loom
live: logical boot
boot: installed 239 jets
litnyr-mostes/.urb/urbit.pill confirmed to exist
boot: loading litnyr-mostes/.urb/urbit.pill
^C
```

i thought it might be a version problem but maybe the git tag is stale and its fine.

```
urbit (master)$ git reset --hard origin/master
HEAD is now at 20c9485 Merge pull request #909 from urbit/dns-arg
urbit (master)$ git describe --long
v0.4.5-139-g20c9485
```
