Yep, Hoon is a functional language after all, even though it can be written in a "procedural" style. I do find myself imagining procedural concepts as I write Hoon, even though I have a bit of background with Scala. Anyhow, thanks for noting those similarities-- I hope more people contribute some fun ways to play with the list!
