I think it helps a lot if programmers already have functional programming experience, because then everything is really easy to explain: (turn a b) is map over list a with function b, and (zing a) is flatmap a. It also gets people thinking about using recursion (which is mandatory) without throwing them into the deep end of learning Hoon as well.
