Hi all,

Maybe this is a bug. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the urbitverse will hate me. Also not sure. But I've been experimenting with syncing and merging from remote desks, as a comet. Also maybe why it's not working... Anyway, I've found that syncs don't seem to update (they continuously say they're synced when they're not), and merges are %fine when they're obviously not. In order to actually get updates, a new comet needed to be made, and the merge (or sync) done all over again. Not sure if it made a difference, but these were on separate invocations of Urbit. My third attempt at an update would have been on the original invocation of Urbit for the second comet, if it hadn't crashed. Thought I'd post here to see if this was a known thing.
My experiments have been with merging or syncing the %home desk of urbit.org to a %test desk on my comets, which is why I considered that the urbitverse might hate me. :)
