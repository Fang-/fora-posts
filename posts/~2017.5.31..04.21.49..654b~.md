In my last post, I shared a Hoon program that will test some integer to see if it's a counterexample to the Goldbach conjecture.  Today we'll be a little more ambitious: let's write a program that will test all numbers in some given range, e.g. from 1 to 30,000.  If a counterexample is found among these numbers, the program will tell us which it is; otherwise we'll get a negative report.  And let's have it work out the answer using a cluster of comets in the cloud!

As wonderful as that sounds, I'll be setting a low bar for this version of the program.  I'm looking for bare minimum functionality, with bare minimum knowledge of Hoon.  (A better version with improved interface, which makes use of more Hoon features, and distributes work more equally, is forthcoming.)  But it does indeed work, and it's wonderful!

(By the way, in case it wasn't clear in previous posts, I believe Goldbach's conjecture is likely true.  There probably isn't a counterexample, and if there is, it's a number so large that our CPUs will all melt before this program finds it.  The point of this exercise is to learn Hoon and demonstrate Urbit's capabilities.  And to have fun!)

I'll actually need to write two programs: one will be a central control program, which takes the initial assignment from the user, and sends a portion of the work to each of the comets.  The other program will run on each of the comets, and will do the hard work of testing its share of the user-provided range.

Here is the first program, the control program, to which I gave the inapt name `goldbach-cluster.hoon`:

```

::
:: This program, when poked with a range of numbers, will send assignments to
:: comets, each of which gets sent a fraction of that range. Each comet will
:: test the numbers in its range to determine whether it contains a counter-

:: Otherwise it sends back a negative report.

This program is to be run as an app on your control ship (let's call it the "mothership").  First, if you haven't already done so, mount the mothership in dojo: `|mount %`.  Then you'll need to put `goldbach-cluster.hoon` in the mothership's `app/` directory.  Finally, start the program in dojo with: `|start %goldbach-cluster`.   Oh yeah, and don't forget to change the names of the comets in the cluster... those comets are mine!  (Actually, if you sweet-talk me sufficiently in urbit-meta, I will let you use my comet cluster, as long as you don't abuse them with utterly massive inputs!)

And, oh yeah, sorry ~zod about starting all those comets...

Now we need its corresponding program, which to be run on each of the comets in the cluster.  In the above program, I assume we have five comets.  You can adjust that obviously, with some minor rewriting, but let's assume you're sticking with five.  You'll need the following, `goldbach-node.hoon`, on each of them:

```

:: goldbach-cluster.hoon
::
:: This program, when poked with a range of numbers, will send assignments to
:: comets, each of which gets sent a fraction of that range. Each comet will
:: test the numbers in its range to determine whether it contains a counter-
:: example to the Goldbach conjecture. If so, it send back a postive report.
:: Otherwise it sends back a negative report.

First, change the mothership value.  You can't have my comet!  For each of the comets in the cluster, you'll need to do the following: (1) mount in dojo: `|mount %`, (2) copy `goldbach-node.hoon` into the `app/` folder, (3) start the app in dojo: `|start %goldbach-node`.

Are we ready to start burning CPU oil?  Not quite.  These programs use marks to send each other ordered pairs.  When we run `goldbach-cluster` on the mothership, we're going to give it a range: `[1 30.000]`, or whatever.  `goldbach-cluster` will divide this up into pieces, each of which is also an ordered pair, and send it as a noun to each comet.  It needs to use the %noun mark to do this.  Unfortunately we are missing a file in the `mar/` directory which allow us to send messages with %noun marks.  So, for all of the ships above, insert the following file, named `noun.hoon`, into the `mar/` directory:

```
::
::::  /hoon/noun/mar
  ::
/?    310
!:
::::  A minimal noun mark
|_  non/*
++  grab  |%
          ++  noun  *
          --
--
```

This program was generously provided by `~tonlur-sarret`!  Thanks `~tonlur`!

Now, go back to the mothership's dojo and enter the following: `:goldbach-cluster [1 30.000]`.  Magic will ensue!  Distributed computing in the cloud... glorious.  You'll get five reports, one from each comet.  When you have all five, you'll have your answer!

And by the way, this really does work more quickly than doing all the calculations on one ship.  On a one-ship version of the program, my computer took 3 minutes, 27 seconds to tackle `[1 30.000]`.  Using the cluster, with the above programs, the time is only 1 minute, 49 seconds!  And your mothership isn't doing any work, so you can chat in urbit-meta while you wait.  Nice!  And the above work isn't even remotely optimized.  Lots of gains are left.  Tune in next time...

Have fun, Martians!
