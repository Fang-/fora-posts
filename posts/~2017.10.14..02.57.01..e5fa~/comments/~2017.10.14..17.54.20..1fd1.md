This looks so good already! Can't wait for TWIU and UPs to go live.

While I'm all for having the latest and greatest prominently displayed on the top of the page, it's probably even more important for new users to learn how to get started. You might want to consider moving the "Users" section to the top so that "get started" is very easily findable.

Other than that, the only thing I'd maybe change is displaying some of the sections under "Developers" next to each other on wider screens, though I'm not entirely sure if that'd look better.

Good stuff ~tonlur!
