title: Chrome tab freeze issue for Urbit.org

So me and others have been experiencing seemingly random freezes of Chrome tabs when we have an Urbit.org page open. I have found a way of consistently reproducing this using the Urbit.org/docs pages, at least on my machine.

1. Navigate to a docs page with a sidebar, any one will do. Initially the page should operate normally, and pressing ctrl-w should close it immediately.
2. Hover your mouse over one, or two, or all of the links in the sidebar. Notice how the cursor doesn't change despite it hovering over a clickable element.
3. You should still be able to scroll through the contents of the page, but try pressing ctrl-w. Depending on the amount of sidebar links you hovered over, it either closes the page after a delay, or (seemingly) doesn't close at all, eventually showing the "tab is not responding" message.

Looking at Chrome's task manager with a frozen tab shows it's CPU usage sitting at 100% and it's memory usage climbing steadily. There's definitely a leak somewhere.

Interestingly, having Chrome's dev console open before triggering the issue via mouse-hover prevents it from happening. Closing the console makes the issue reproducible again. Opening the console in a frozen tab currently shows nothing interesting.

To whoever gets to pick this up: enjoy! (;
