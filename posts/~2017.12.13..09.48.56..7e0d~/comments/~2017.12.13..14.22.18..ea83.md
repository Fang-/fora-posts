Hi ~ponmep-litsem, ~divmec-panfex here. This looks like a dream come true. I'm especially looking forward to the ability to edit source files from the web interface, but sounds like that will need to wait for the clay integration. 

UI looks really good so far. Eventually we may want tabs/multiple files, depending on what the performance trade-offs look like. Is there any particular aspect of the current mockup that has you concerned?
