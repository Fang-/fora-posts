`%ap-slam-mismatch` is %gall ("app") trying to call ("slam") the gate in one of your standard app arms and getting a nest-fail. In this case, the sample mold of the `++peek` gate is `{ren/@tas tyl/path}`, but the actual sample is just a path. The mold is what the interface used to be, but it's changed now. That symbol, the `++care` of the namespace read, happens to be the first item of the path. [This pr](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/415/files#diff-38dfb32a96a640bc529ec7f373eeeeecL200) has an example.
