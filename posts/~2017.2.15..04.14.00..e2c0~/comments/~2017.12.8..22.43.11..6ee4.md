Hi `~rocbyt`. I think when you deleted that directory, your planet went with it. (If I'm understanding correctly). Since our network messages are ordered, the network wont let you re-initialize that name.

In the future, it will be possible to start a planet again so long as you know the initial secret. But, that's a `cc-release` planned feature.
