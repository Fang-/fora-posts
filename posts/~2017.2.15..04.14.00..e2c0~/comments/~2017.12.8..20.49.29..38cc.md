Just to clarify everything, here's the sequence of steps I performed:

In the new continuity era, after the breach:
1. build urbit from the v0.5.1 git tag
2. run urbit with the -w and -t tags
result: get to dojo for planet, as expected
3. quit urbit
4. delete directory created by urbit, except saving passcode file
5. run urbit with the -w and -t tags
result: get to dojo for comet

Can I recover my planet?
