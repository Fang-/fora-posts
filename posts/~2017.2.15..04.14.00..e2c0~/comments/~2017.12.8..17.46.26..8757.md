Hey ~rocbyt!

We performed a network continuity breach yesterday afternoon and evening (`~2017.12.7`). Depending on your timing yesterday, you may or may not have tried to boot from our latest release, `urbit-0.5.1`. We don't have prebuilt packages yet as we're fixing a few bugs before propagating the release to the various Unix package managers, so we're asking people to build from source for now.

Basically, if you tried rebooting your planet a second time with the old `urbit-0.4.5` binary, you're in luck. You can use the same ticket to boot your planet in this new continuity era, live now. You can follow the updated instructions in our [Install doc](https://urbit.org/docs/using/install). For more information on what a continuity breach is, you can read our short explanation in [this document](https://urbit.org/docs/using/admin/#-continuity-breaches).

If you did in fact try booting once before on the `urbit-0.5.1` release and your planet didn't metamorphose out of its comet chrysalis (this is how our current boot sequence works), this is a bug. Please email us with further details and any stack traces if you have them.

Sorry this didn't go smoothly the first time! Hopefully we can get this sorted out for you soon.
