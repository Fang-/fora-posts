I am also having trouble with my planet (`~timtem-fosret`). Some *long* time ago I've noticed that an update lead to conflicts and my `:talk` stopped working. Finally I've followed the advice from [Forcing a "merge theirs"](https://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2016.8.10..23.35.24..8cba~) and it improved my situation a bit (I'm able to access web GUI locally), though it still isn't perfect -- I've stored `|merge` output as [a gist](https://gist.github.com/pefimo/10d256062c4fc4e08c0f55c84ee10ed5).

Will the upcoming breach 'fix' my planet? Will I be able to re-start it? Or maybe it would be possible to cure my planet before the breach?

Thanks in advance!
