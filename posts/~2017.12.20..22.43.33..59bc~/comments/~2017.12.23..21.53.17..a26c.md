See https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit for inspiration, perhaps? Urbit has the global namespace part of IPFS already. Maybe this is a point of interface for IPFS, or maybe some more urbit specific IPFS-like thing should be built. I'm mostly exploring these ideas, but I want others to explore them as well. I don't know what performance is like for IPFS. I can imagine some sort of bittorent-like chat protocol for urbit, though - something more content-centric networking, since we have all these lovely encryption keys just laying about.
