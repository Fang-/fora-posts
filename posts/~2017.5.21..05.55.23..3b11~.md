(apologize if this is double post, submission is being weird for me)

I wrote this small gall app to test subscribing to changes on clay from an app
```
1 ::
 2 ::
 3 ::::  experiment with subscribing to a dir
 4   ::
 5   ::
 6 /?    310
 7 |%
 8   ++  card  {$warp sock riff}
 9   ++  move  {bone card}                          ::
10 --                                               ::
11 !:                                               ::
12 |_  {hid/bowl state/$~}                          ::
13 ++  poke-noun
14   |=  {a/path b/@ud c/@ud}
15   ^-  (quip move +>.$)
16   =|  {soc/sock mot/moat car/card rif/riff}
17   =.  mot
18     [[%ud b] [%ud c] a]
19   =.  soc
20     [our.hid our.hid]
21   =.  rif
22     [%home [~ [%many | mot]]]
23   =.  car
24     :+
25       %warp
26       soc
27       rif
28   [[[ost.hid %warp soc rif] ~] +>.$]
29   ::
30 --
```

It compiles but comes back with the following error:

```
> :sub [/web 2 10]
gall: %sub: pass: malformed path
```

Can anyone give me some guidance on what's going on here?
