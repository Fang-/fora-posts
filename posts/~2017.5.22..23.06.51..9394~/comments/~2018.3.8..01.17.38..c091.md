Thanks ponmep. But, in pratice, how would backuping a urbit actually work in real life, specially if its a remote backup? My understanding is that a out of sync backup cannot rejoin the network: so even if I keep a 24h old backup in one place, then my online urbit gets shutdown by an adversary, how can I restore the backup elsewhere?
