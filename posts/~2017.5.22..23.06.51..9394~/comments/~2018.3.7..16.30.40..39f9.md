Of course, if your urbit hard drive breaks, you best have a backup. But it is different, in that urbit is self contained.

You copy pier, you copy everything, restarting it from Inner Mongolia is just typing urbit in the console. Now I dare you to move your complex webservive to the other end of the world from your backup ; )

This might seem not a big deal, but urbit solves a lot of problems by being a new kind of network on top of internet cruft. It is not the same as docker images or whatever bandaid was invented to tame Unix these days.

Urbit being technically a pure transition function is virtually immune to any resets. Unless your drive malfunctions, there is no such thing as reset in the urbit world. Your system just took longer than usual to respond to packets. Your urbit can not even *perceive* reset happened unless someone explicitly transfer that information from the outside.
