{quote}Since Galaxies are the only entities with the right to vote, and all galaxies are created by founders, I assume that galaxies will be distributed very carefully and deliberately.

Could you comment more about how galaxies might be created and distributed?{quote}

Galaxies are not the only entities with the right to vote. This is laid out in the interim constitution (https://urbit.org/posts/constitution/). The galaxy distribution is also listed there, along with Tlon's pledge to distribute 50 galaxies to the public at a future time.
