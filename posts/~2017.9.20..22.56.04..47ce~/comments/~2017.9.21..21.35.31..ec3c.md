It's important for people to remember that we're using Ethereum because (a) it's a blockchain, (b) it seems to be able to hold large amounts of economic value if you don't shoot yourself in the foot, and (c) it can enforce Urbit title registry semantics.

A rational Bitcoin maximalist (some of our best friends are Bitcoin maximalists) should note that the rational maximalist objection is to *holding* altcoins, not *trading* them.  Yes, if you want to buy Urbit real estate for Bitcoin, you'll have to trade *through* ETH.  But you won't have to hold it.  You are not putting economic energy into an alternate digital currency.

Currently star ownership is in a private database and galaxy ownership is checked into the source code in Github.  So we're improving on a rather non-2017 system.

We'll have more details about the rollout/sale later.  Obviously people with stars/planets will have their ownership records migrated to the blockchain.

Remember also that the power to hard fork remains at the human layer -- if Urbit as a whole coherently decides that it wants to move its registry to another contract or another blockchain, or handle it itself, it can.  In the end, it's always bags of meat that decide.
