Thanks. I'd also love to hear more detail about this quote from the blog post: "since Urbit keys are valuable, you don’t want to put them in an operating system that isn’t generally recognized as systematically secure. It’s hard to achieve this status while you’re a testnet. So the virtuous cycle never gets started."

What's so valuable about a current Urbit key? If I lose my ship's key, can't I just email Tlon, and get a new one? Won't this continue to be viable as long as Tlon controls Urbit? So why is Tlon in such a hurry to cede control of Urbit to The Ethereum Consensus Mob, whose first concerted action was to throw a bunch of money at whoever noticed an obscure feature of the DAO, and whose second action was a hard-fork to steal it all back? I can easily imagine *those* Urbit keys becoming the most valuable thing on the Ether blockchain (or indeed, the only thing of any value whatsoever). So if The Mob decides to hard-fork to steal Urbit power from the Galactic Senate, what would happen? (Such a hard-fork will get easier after the ICO bubble pops, and ETH itself becomes cheap or worthless, and the network hash power drops.) --lyd
