While not strictly necessary, it is quite the opposite of reinventing the wheel.

We're currently looking at using MyEtherWallet's logic to power our own interface. It already provides a way to interact with arbitrary contracts out of the box, so we should be able to hook the constitution up to that fairly easily.

More importantly, MEW has already done an amazing job of providing a secure and flexible client. You can sign into it in a huge number of different ways, be it via hardware wallet, Metamask, a keystore file, mnemonic phrase or even a raw private key. This isn't the kind of stuff we want to be reimplementing ourselves.  
It also allows you to use any arbitrary Ethereum node to send your transaction, or can work entirely offline if you want it to.
