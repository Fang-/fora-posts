This looks like it might not post under any kind of recognizable name. This is ~palfun aka ~palnup speaking. I've been working on actually implementing all this stuff. Crazy!

> how planet sales work, which I didn't get

We will provide code for an Ethereum contract that star owners can put onto the blockchain. When they do, they can tell it how many planets they want to sell, and how many Ether every planet will cost. After telling the constitution that "hey, the contract with that address is allowed to grant planets for me", people will be able to buy planets by sending Ether to the sale contract. The star owner can withdraw this Ether from the contract.

The intricacies of the sale contract itself are still somewhat undecided (Can a buyer get a specific planet? Can a seller specify a range or set of planets to sell?), and we need to figure out a tidy way to help people discover planet sales. The broad strokes as outlined above are set though!
