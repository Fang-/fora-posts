I don't understand why the plan is always focused on "sale stars". I haven't seen a sounding plan for how the integration between Urbit and Ethereum would happen. Bootstrapping the PKI from Ethereum basically means that Urbit needs to "cross-mined" with Ethereum (at least for the beginning), and that would require every user to download the whole Ethereum blockchain even if that is something they don't care.

The galaxy PKI acts similar to blockchain's genesis block. Nobody working in blockchain would put that into another blockchain, unless they're working on a sidechain. If the problem is that star PKIs are not transparent enough, then the good way to fix it is to create the Urbit way, rather than delegate it to Ethereum. (Unless you're saying "Urbit sucks, let's all migrate to Ethereum".)

Anyway, the Solri galaxy, star and planet giveaway is happening. [https://zod.that.world/giveaway/](https://zod.that.world/giveaway/)
