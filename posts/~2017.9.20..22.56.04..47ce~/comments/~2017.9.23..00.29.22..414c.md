"50 galaxies to the public" is not quite the correct interpretation - we mean "50 galaxies to urbit.org, to support the growth and development of the system."

Only galaxies vote in the draft Ethereum contract, because the network is born in a "state of emergency" where all decisions are strategic and hence senatorial.

We'll talk at greater length about the galaxy distribution in another post.  A lot of development work has gone into Urbit; there is no mining or public distribution.
