Roughly speaking, languages/dev platforms fall in a spectrum between "wordy" and "pithy".  Hoon/Urbit is way over on the "pithy" end.  This is great, since you can get a lot done with very little code.

The problem with pithy coding is that you have to know exactly what you're doing to get anything done.  It's lots of staring at the screen and being frustrated before you find the (literally) one character you need to change, and then everything starts working.

The good news is, unlike wordy coding, you end up with fewer "spurious successes", where the code works almost as an unintended side-effect of what you thought you were working on.
