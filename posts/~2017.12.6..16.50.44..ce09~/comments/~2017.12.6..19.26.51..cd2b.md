~ribwyd_marzod, it is an operating system. It can do anything you like. Within the system. 
Urbit is a self-contained VM ("browser for the server-side"). 
In practice the only accessible link to outside is through decks. (Unless there are supposed too be some Vere hacks, which would break sandboxing...)

You also can do anything you like in the browser using javascript, also a self contained operating system except you can't freely access outside world. 

There is no FFI in urbit.
