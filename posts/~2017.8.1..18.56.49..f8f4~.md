My latest project is a wiki for Urbit. Unlike fora/talk it's a place for collaborative curation of content.

It is based on %clay for keeping the history, and urbit's identity system (any planet/star/galaxy can post/edit, testing the assumption that people won't spam when their reputation is at stake).

In its current state it is missing many features, but is barely usable. You can view and edit articles, create new ones and view the history.

I've been learning a lot while building this so I realize now I made some poor design choices. In any case, comments are welcome.

The source is at [github](https://github.com/asssaf/urbit-wiki).

A demo is running on a comet:
