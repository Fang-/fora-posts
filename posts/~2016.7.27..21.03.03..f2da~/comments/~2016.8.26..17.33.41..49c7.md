> ## The -lut suffix produces some unfortunate ship names
>
> I noticed this when I stumbled across `0xde75.0100`. While this planet name is hilarious, I remember reading somewhere that the phonetic base was purged of some syllables (e.g. **fap**) to avoid that sort of thing. Evidently **lut** was missed.
> 
> Since this issue occurs with numerous prefixes (**bis**, **hos**, **mis**, **das**...) this issue will not be especially rare, so you might want to change **lut** to something less giggle-inducing. I propose **luf**.
