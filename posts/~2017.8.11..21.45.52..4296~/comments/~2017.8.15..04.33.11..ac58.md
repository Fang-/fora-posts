One thing I didn't understand is the uniform tokens model (assuming that all planets/stars/galaxies have the same value in their class).

If we use the real estate metaphor, each property will have a different value and buyers will have to bid on it until there is a winner.

How can we assume that all property is equivalent? Even for brand new ships this is unlikely, and almost definitely not for "used" property. 

In today's world is very common for people to buy accounts on various social networks, buy karma on reddit etc. Not that this is a positive thing, but there is definitely demand.
