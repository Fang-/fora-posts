It's worth noting that the Hacker News-like site [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) does this: Their site is invite-only, with it keeping track of who invited you. If you're banned, then it looks back on your referer, and potentially get banned themselves if acting in bad faith.

Honestly, my only criticism with Urbit's network is that there are too few stars that sign too many planets. 65,000 is a /lot/ of people, and so that burden of proof that it's worth banning all of them is simply too high. Even if you have 200 bots under the star that are pedonazi spambots, it's simply better to blacklist them individually...which just leaves you with the current system.
