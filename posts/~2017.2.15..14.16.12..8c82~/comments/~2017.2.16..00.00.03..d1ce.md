I actually meant to point that out in my article but forgot :) I wrote this in a bout with insomnia so consider it a _very_ rough draft.

Point taken, and I'm inclined to agree. However, people love labels, and when it comes to this fascist talk I strongly believe that the label is being mis-used to it's own detriment. If people keep crying wolf like this, without actually understanding what they are talking about, it leaves them susceptible to more subtle forms of control such as [Facebook's newsfeed effectively causing depression](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069841) or promoting fake news, or [Twitter's shadow banning](http://blog.dilbert.com/post/156806516721/the-social-media-hive-mind). I think it's worth it at least have an argument and an understanding about the structure of fascism ready for when needed, and so I shared my (rudimentary) analysis here. Reproductions of this article could certainly cut out the last few paragraphs.
