Our IPv6 support in general is kind of, uh, slated for future development. I think ames.hoon allows for it in theory, but hasn't been tested because the libuv glue doesn't; and e.g. the URL type (let alone parser) doesn't allow for the http://[::addr] literal form.

IPv6 http clients might work? P:
