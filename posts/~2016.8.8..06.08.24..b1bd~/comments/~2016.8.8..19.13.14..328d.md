## `~fyr`
This is far closer to urb.js than urb.py: the latter uses a privileged local-only port, so it doesn't require authentication but conversely wouldn't really work for mobile clients.

`$%({$ok %&} {$fail tape})` is standardized insofar as the eyre arms `++nice-json` and `++mean-json` are generally used for serving positive/negative acknowledgments. Eyre crashes on .json urls should probably also give a `{fail}`, at present it's always html.
