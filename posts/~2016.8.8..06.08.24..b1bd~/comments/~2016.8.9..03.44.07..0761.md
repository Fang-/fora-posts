In [http_io_init](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/cd972fc8efbe73b93baddd92d9cde75dc5bba843/vere/http.c#L1091-L1150), the port 12321 listener is configured to use the loopback address (`htp_u->lop = c3y;`).  This is tested by [_http_start](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/cd972fc8efbe73b93baddd92d9cde75dc5bba843/vere/http.c#L1048-L1054) and determines whether or not the socket should be bound on `127.0.0.1` or `0.0.0.0`.  Note also the address is created as `AF_INET`, which is IPv4 specifically.
