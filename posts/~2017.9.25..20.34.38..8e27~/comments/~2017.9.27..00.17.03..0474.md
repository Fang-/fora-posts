The arguments are not convincing--especially the bit about the "strongest computational blockchain"--and neither is the urgency. And, why not do a test launch on a private Ethereum, e.g., on Azure or elsewhere for free? There are too many ETH-based scams out there, including ETH price manipulation itself, and you're sullying urbit's reputation. 

I'll wait & see, in the meantime, it's back to Plan 9, Inferno, EROS, Shapiro's work at JHU, a VMWare dirty page log, or 1980s work by Tandom on process-pairs using event-capture for deterministic replay (Tandem NonStop's fault-tolerance).
