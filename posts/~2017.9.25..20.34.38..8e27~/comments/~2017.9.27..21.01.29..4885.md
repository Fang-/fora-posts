Addendum: I believe there is great power in the existing Urbit parent-trust model. As ~dasper discussed above, a list of galaxies embedded in source code which every user can audit gives some degree of confidence in the network. From that base I can trust my star and galaxy to give me the network's full map. Putting all pier ownership on a blockchain makes it non-trivial to trust even galaxies, although that proof gives me a full picture. And I have no idea how common title transfer will be under the system, but as a user I have no choice but to trust the blockchain record that says a key was transferred while in the current system I don't have to care.
