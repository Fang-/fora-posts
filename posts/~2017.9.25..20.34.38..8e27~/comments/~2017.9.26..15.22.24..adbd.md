Re: "tooling support"...is exactly same.

Agreed. The arguments for ETH are looking thinner. 

And the following is troubling: those who hold the ETH pre-mine represent >70% of the total supply, the supply is being decreased in the hard fork, and PoS favors these early adopters and eliminates miners. This and its weak tech are making it look like a pump & dump scam, and you're taking what looks like a completely unnecessary risk associating yourself with it.
