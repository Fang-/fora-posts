> Building Urbit on a current PoW Ethereum chain will just make it slower.

I suspect there's some confusion in what this proposal entails. No one is suggesting that urbit ships should run within Ethereum. I'm not sure what else that statement could be implying ...

What is proposed is simply an ETH title registry for urbit addresses, along with smart contracts to manage transfers of said addresses. This system in no way replaces or fundamentally alters Urbit itself -- it just moves ownership records from private databases at Tlon to a public blockchain, and allows address transfers to be made without Tlon's mediation.

And it's been stated several times already that Urbit retains the capability to move off of this Ethereum registry at any time. The trust roots for the Urbit network remain, as always, the galaxies.
