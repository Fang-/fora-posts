> I give [Ethereum address] ownership of this child

Perhaps I am misunderstanding/overemphasizing this point, but does this PKI scheme then mean that Ethereum addresses become the primary way to identify Urbit owners? While I have many many reservations about Ethereum using it as a registry would not be a huge issue to me if that registry were secondary to controlling my own secret keys and managing my own identity. Forcing all ship owners to associate themselves with an Ethereum address to use Urbit seems overreaching from my perspective.
