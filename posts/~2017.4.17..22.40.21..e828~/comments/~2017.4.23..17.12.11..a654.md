In general, I find the [github network view](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/network) to be a good way to look at what different people are doing.

But more specifically, ~palfun's talk work is [on his talk-split branch](https://github.com/Fang-/arvo/tree/talk-split), ~pittyp's console work is [on his repeer branch](https://github.com/ohAitch/arvo/tree/repeer), and ~sorreg's decoration work is [here](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/pull/389). I remember seeing Raymond's daemonization work (and thinking it was neato), but I can't find it right now.

Keaton's feed thing is [here](https://github.com/keatondunsford/feed.git) ([Separate fora post](https://urbit.org/~~/fora/posts/~2017.4.12..21.14.00..fe17~/).
