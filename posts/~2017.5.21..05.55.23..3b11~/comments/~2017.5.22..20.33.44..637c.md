## `~sorreg-namtyv`
You are almost right on with this, but when you use Arvo system cards from userspace, and are passing forward, you need to include a `++wire` (ie, `path`) in the card definition.  So it should be `{%warp wire sock riff}`.  Intuitively, the wire is your callback address to route the return note.

Also, using `=|` to define variables and then `=.` to set them is a little un-Hoonish... I would use `=+` or `=/` if you have a variable you're going to use more than once, `=*` for a one-time alias.
