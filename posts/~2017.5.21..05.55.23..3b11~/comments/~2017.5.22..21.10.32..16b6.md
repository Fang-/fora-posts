Thanks, ~sorreg ! I kind of bumbled into the wire/writ format by poking around the kiln code.

But now I get this error:

`[! gall: %sub: pour: no writ: /sync  [%ap-lame %sub %writ]]`

I'm not sure if this because there is no writ (I'd assume because no response?) or if this is because there's no arm to receive the writ. If it's the latter, what is the arm format for receiving a writ?
