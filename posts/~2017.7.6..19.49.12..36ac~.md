Friends, Martians,

We will be having the inaugural LA Urbit (https://urbit.org) meetup next Sunday, July 16. This edition will be low key, but expect some or all of the following: beer, relative merits of runes v keywords in hoon, sunshine, crypto gossip, nock jokes, backyard burgers, musings on interface design, literary vulgarity, new friends and, of course, saving the internet.

TL;DR
Urbit meetup, LA
Sunday July 16, 5-8pm
298 Molino Ave., Long Beach CA 90803
