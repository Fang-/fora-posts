For the setup then looping, in Hoon terms you would have a gate for GTE and in that run code, with one of the computations being fetching an arm in an anonymous core. I'm not actually that sure if there's 

`|=  {a/@ b/@} 
This is setup
=+  [i j]=[a b]
|-
This is in the new core
Can recurse to either the outer gate, or the trap
$(i +(i), j +(j))
`

I think that your formula is basically equivalent, though, since the outer gate isn't *really* needed. The axises for a and b would be different in the loop, though.
