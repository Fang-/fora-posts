First, make sure `goldbachce.hoon` is in the `gen` directory.  Next, check that you're prefixing `goldbachce 112` with a plus sign:

`+goldbachce 112`

All the Hoon files in the `gen` directory are generators, and you must always start with `+` to run one of those.  (Hence the reason we use `+ls` rather than `ls`... `ls.hoon` is a generator.)
