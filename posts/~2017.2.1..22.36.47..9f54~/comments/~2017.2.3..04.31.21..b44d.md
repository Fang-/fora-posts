The problem with command line interfaces, even kid-friendly ones like the one sketched out, are how many unknown unknowns you have. You have a lot of neat things you can do, but don't know that they are there, or even that you are missing them in the first place. It very much needs good enumeration and hand-holding to get antiquated, and even then I wouldn't give it to my mom.

The friendly boot process looks great ("here is how to setup and initialize your ship"), but then you not only need to know /how/ to connect to twitter from the command line, but that you /can/ connect to twitter from the command line. Perish the thought that you have to download the app from some star-hosted app store first, either.

I'm heartily in favor of more periodic updates instead of larger brain-dumps like these. It's pretty impossible to know what the good people at Tlon are working on right now, were before it was much easier to follow. I await the day I can use Urbit as a twitter mirror, access point, and replacement.
