The canonical way for Urbit to use 3rd party websites is through REST apis. Hoon has parsers for JSON that lets it cast it to types the app can use natively. We have a github adapter that provides a library that the necessary functionality, for example, and it would be the same with any other website. Those adapters are in Urbit, though, so there's nothing websites have to do to work well with Urbit (eventually, of course, since a lot of this isn't fully baked yet).

Dojo wasn't designed to be the one true UI for Urbit. That's the web. The plan is to develop websites that can talk to Urbit apps (Things like web `:talk` work by pretending your browser is a comet, and apps treat messages from it exactly the same, which is basically magic), not develop dojo UIs to replace websites.
