### Questions
1. Are all the the api's/services you consume done in Dojo? Does this mean there is no need for JavaScript frontend code once UI concepts are mapped to React components that Dojo can call?
2. Say I'm a business owner and I want to provide services for Urbit users to consume. I already have a RESTful api that my websites UI uses can I levrage the work done on that API already with Urbit? How do I get Dojo to understand what the user can do? Do I need to create an [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) API with user inputs specified via API service or is this done on the Urbit (Client Side) or are both an option? What would the process of getting on board with Urbit look like for me?
