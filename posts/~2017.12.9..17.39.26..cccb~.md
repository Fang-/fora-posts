Hello fellow Urbiters(?),

Is there a chance to set up email notifications when a new Urbit blog post appears?
I know there's a lot of dogfooding going on in here and interfacing oldschool email might not be a priority within Urbit, but I think even a non-urbit solution is worth implementing in this case. I would love to stay passively updated with Urbit's status, and I currently find the only way this happens is when a random interrupt fires in my brain making me check urbit.org manually, which is I shame because I miss a lot of the news and opportunity to discuss matters when they're "hot".

Maybe there is such an option and I'm just missing it?

Thanks
