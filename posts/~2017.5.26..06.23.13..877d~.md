`~taglux-nidsep` here, with simple prime checker in Hoon.  (Sadly my planet sank!  But it will return...)  The following program will take an atom (unsigned integer) as input, and return '0' if it's prime, and '1' otherwise.  (Remember, in Martian, '0' is 'yes' and '1' is 'no'.)

The program:

    |=  n/@                  :: n is the input
    =/  i  2                 :: let i = 2
    =/  j  2                 :: let j = 2
    ?:  (lth n 2)  1         :: If n < 2 then return 1, else...
    ?:  (lth n 4)  0         :: If n < 4 then return 0, else...
    |-                       :: Start of loop
    ?:  =((mul i j) n)       :: If (i * j) = n then...
      1                      :: ...return 1, else...
    ?:  =((add j 1) n)       :: If (j + 1) = n then...
      0                      :: return 0, else...
    ?:  (gth (mul i j) n)    :: If (i * j) > n then...
      $(i 2, j (add j 1))    :: Let i = 2, add 1 to j, and loop, else...
    $(i (add i 1))           :: Add 1 to i and loop.

To run this program, do the following:

--If you haven't done it already, `mount` your home desk: enter `|mount %` in dojo.
--Paste the above program into a text editor and save it as "prime.hoon" in your `gen` directory.
--Test it out by entering the following in dojo: `+prime 111`

You should get `1` as your answer, because 111 isn't prime (37 * 3 = 111).

This program runs much, much faster in dojo than the Nock version from my earlier post.  It responds with `0` almost instantly when you enter `+prime 11.717`.  The Nock version of the program, on the other hand... I've never been patient enough to wait for an answer for `11.717`, because it takes too long.  I guess Hoon has its advantages.

Enjoy!
