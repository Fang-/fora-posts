We already have the %app speech type, but it's only for normal @t messages right now. Maybe the better way would be to change that go {$app p/term q/speech} instead? Then consumers of talk can ignore app messages to only get 100% free range humans.

Comets are, by design, without social standing. It's like having 4chan users on your app: reputationless. The social rules definitely say to ban them by default, or at least minimize them behind a spoiler.
