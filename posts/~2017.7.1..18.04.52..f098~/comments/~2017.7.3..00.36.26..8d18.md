I started working on [a new stdlib](https://github.com/eglaysher/arvo/blob/new-stdlib/lib/new-hoon.hoon). I made some progress translating portions of Haskell's Data.Maybe and Data.List. However, I quickly found that I wanted the type system to be extended. I'm currently poking at [arvo#391](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues/391) to make sure all new containers both take and return the correct spans.

As for the usual bikeshedding on ideas...

My current approach is to structure names like:

    |%
    ++  ls
      |%
      ++  foldl
      [...]
      --
    --

so that for a list, you would call (foldl:ls ...). Hoon doesn't have Haskell's type deduction and can't select between foldl:ls and foldl:mp based on the type signature. So my current thinking is vowelless namespace cores for each type. You can always `=,` in a local scope if you're calling a bunch of list functions and no map functions.
