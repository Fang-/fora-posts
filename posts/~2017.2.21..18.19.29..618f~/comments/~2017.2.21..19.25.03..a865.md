Ugh, sorry!  You should know that the current era is temporary and all ships will be recreated, but there are several ship-sinking bugs in the wild today.  In particular I'm no means confident that our disk handling code is power-interruption-proof.

Try deleting your checkpoint: rm -rf sidser-salbex/.urb/chk

If it's the checkpoint that's corrupt and not the log, this'll fix it.  Otherwise, we'll have to send you a spare planet, but the "strange attachment" is real and you'll get it back on cc-release...
