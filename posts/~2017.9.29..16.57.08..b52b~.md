from unix-filesystem (while ship is running) I've managed to edit the css under /urbit-ship/site/web/tree/main.css. The first changes seemed to have worked but no further changes seemed to have...

Also, I accidentally deleted web.plan but my %home Name and location still are present and I can edit them from web-ui. where are these being saved?

Is this how we should be editing files from unix-filesystem?
