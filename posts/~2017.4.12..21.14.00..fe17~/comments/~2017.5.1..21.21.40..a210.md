Right. In general, all of this stuff will be a lot easier in the next release. And in addition `:feed` was a small experiment in deployment alone. Which certainly has been interesting. It's been working on some ships and not others. Overall, anybody just trying this out now, let me know what problems you're facing. I'm almost always in `:talk` too.
