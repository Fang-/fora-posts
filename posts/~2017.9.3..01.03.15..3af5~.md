All, I have this url that is reachable via browser and curl, but doesn't work via dojo or the %hiss %sigh pattern in my dinky little app.

`https://soundcloud.com/oembed?url=https://soundcloud.com/jahseh-onfroy/king&format=json`

I thought that maybe it had to do with the url in the quay, but this one works:

`https://vimeo.com/api/oembed.json?url=http://vimeo.com/76979871`

Can someone help me debug? Would appreciate any guidance.
