* [Here](http://urbit.org/~~/fora/posts/~2016.7.27..20.10.38..fb09~.md) is the raw `.md` of the post above.  You can also switch the extension to `.html`.
* [Here](http://urbit.org/~~/fora/posts/~2016.7.27..20.10.38..fb09~/comments/~2016.7.27..20.16.51..c66a/) is a link to one of the comments below.

The main thing to notice is that comments just create a subtree below the post they're attached to.  They're just markdown files.
