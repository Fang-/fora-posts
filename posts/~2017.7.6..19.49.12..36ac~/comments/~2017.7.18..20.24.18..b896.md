I had a great time meeting everyone and talking about Urbit in person. If you are reading this right now, trying to decide whether it's worth coming out to the next Urbit gathering in your area: DO IT. 

You will be introduced to a bunch of friendly, like-minded people, and this entire project will become something tangible to you, backed by real humans in meatspace, not just an elaborate practical joke potentially perpetrated by an eccentric AI.

It's a valuable psychological shift. Trust me.
