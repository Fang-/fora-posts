Very cool!

Looking over the Hoon really quick, it definitely seems like you're using too many `=/`'s. Also look into using `(tope [our %home %da now] (flop ~['your' 'path' 'here']))`, which might be better than all those scows for the path. The fact that everything is untyped JSON definitely makes it a bit messier, since you need a bunch of calls to jtape or other conversions when you want the data. Setting up marks would be harder, but better in the long run.

This is pretty cool :) When :talk first came out there was a kanban-esque app called :work that was built on it, but markdown files are probably a better approach. It's always good to have people cutting their teeth on how apps on urbit will actually work.
