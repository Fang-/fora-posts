Riveting story.  The u3 sytem is unique in my experience, in that something can be slightly wrong on such a fundamental level (equality testing misuses the memory allocator), but a single competent programmer can still dive from the application level all the way to that level, understanding every level in between.

This should result in a very stable system eventually, because even application developers will be able to fix system problems that they run into.  The promise of open source was that anyone can fix bugs, but with large and complex systems like Linux, this isn't even close to practical for most people.  Urbit may bring us back to that.
