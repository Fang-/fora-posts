Finally, you asked about `++mull`.

There are three main loops in `++ut`, which probably ought to be unified through functional black magic.  But I don't really mind the cut-and-paste.  `++play` takes a span and a twig; it's just inference. `++mint` is `++play` plus typechecking (to localize type errors, we pass in a goal span) and code generation (it produces `{p/span q/nock}`).  `++play` is `p:mint`.

`++mull` tests conservatively whether, given *two* subject spans `sut` and `dox`, the code generated by twig `gen` for span `sut` can be used with a subject actually in `dox`.  It's slightly more complicated than `=(q:(~(mint ut sut) gol gen)) q:(~(mint ut dox) gol gen))`, but again not by much.  Obviously this problem is deeply related to genericity / wet arms.  The product of `++mull` is both product spans; it crashes if there is a mismatch (those wonderful `mull-bonk-b` errors).

It should be easy to see how these three functions, plus a parser and some macro expansions, constitute a Hoon compiler...
