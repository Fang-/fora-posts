Look at `++moot`, which is in there only because it's elegant and beautiful even though nothing uses it.  `++moot` tests conservatively if a `++span` is the empty set.

The entire code is:
```
  ::
  ++  moot
    =+  gil=*(set span)
    |-  ^-  ?
    ?-  sut
      {$atom *}  |
      {$cell *}  |($(sut p.sut) $(sut q.sut))
      {$core *}  $(sut p.sut)
      {$face *}  $(sut q.sut)
      {$fork *}  (lien (~(tap in p.sut)) |=(span ^$(sut +<)))
      {$hold *}  |((~(has in gil) sut) $(gil (~(put in gil) sut), sut repo))
      $noun      |
      $void      &
    ==
```

For everything besides `%hold`, what we're doing is obvious.  For `%hold`, we are traversing the implicit span graph by lazy evaluation.  `++repo` expands `sut` by one step -- for `{$hold p/span q/twig}` it produces (to simplify a little) `(~(play ut p) q)`, that is, the type produced by q

`++ut` is one of the oldest, most important, and worst documented parts of Urbit.  It is not actually terribly complex, though.
