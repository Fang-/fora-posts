Doccords for any arbitrary twig seems like overkill to me. What are the use cases outside of a) the whole core and b) an arm of a core?

I'd just print the span of the sample and the span of the product:

```
> -:!>(+6:add)
#t/{a/@ b/@}
> -:!>($:add)
#t/@
```

Printing the name of the arm where we got the mold that produced the span (or something like that) would be a bigger change. One, i think, that should be made everywhere if it's made anywhere.

I agree that a `^` rune is technically correct, but it feels a little odd. It's not part of the "type" in any of the ways we'd normally mean -- even though it's stored in the span. I kind of like making arms 1-or-2-fixed: if it's two, the first twig is the doccord ...
