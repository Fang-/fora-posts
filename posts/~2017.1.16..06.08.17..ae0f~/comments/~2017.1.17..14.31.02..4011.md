I would prefer to leave it as a regular rune, honestly (no irregular form).  Since we're using # already as a marker for help, what about ^# though? ^: makes me think of cells.

If we are storing doccords for arbitrary twigs (which I think is the correct choice), let's not bother adding core-specific machinery. There is no need to. Just have the renderer for doccords recurse into the span and render child doccords at an indent. It covers all cases, it's simple, and gives the documentation author complete freedom.
