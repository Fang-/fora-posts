The focus on time is an interesting one, ~hidtes.

But what about lurkers, people who just want to read content but don't care much to participate? For public read private write circles you can just ignore them, but what about fully public or private ones?

It doesn't always seem fair to demand users actually contribute often. Their contributions just have to be good if they do. I'd rather have someone who spends five minutes a week posting high quality content to a circle, than someone who spends five hours without contributing much of substance.

Social upvoting is indeed *a* solution, but also one we've seen "fail" in the past. It's difficult to prevent a hivemind from taking over and effectively censoring everything it doesn't agree with.

One model that has been suggested for content "policing" is having people tag their content for what it is. Think of it as how not safe for work or spoiler content is handled on modern platforms: because it's clearly marked, users who aren't interested in that type of content can easily filter it out.  
This may also help strengthen the bubbling effect I described in the post though, but again, people will want it.
