## `~tonlur-sarret`
I'll definitely have to think about all this more and re-read a few times. From first read, it seems like this kind of social circling should be generalized into its own cross-app library, similar to what `~pittyp` and I are doing now with the `sole` protocol for console apps. I could totally see this same kind of social circling / indexing / graph-walking integrated into things like `%clayhub`, IPFS-linked trackers, gaming on Urbit, and a ton of other stuff. Then `:talk` should just use this standardized protocol.
These are hard design problems in general. To some extent, the tech is easy; human are complicated.
