Having let this sit and simmer in the back of my mind for some time, I agree there's nothing that can be done about self-bubbling, and that there's not much inherently wrong about it. In fact, it allows for people and communities to stray further from the global average. As long as forging connections to/between bubbles outside your own is as easy as for "closer" connections, there is no problem here at all.

That aside in the original post now reads to me as perhaps a bit naive, wishful. Misguided? The point of Urbit is to let communities furnish their own collective internet, with the people and content they want to see on it. Trying to nudge that in any direction at all is Not Correct.
