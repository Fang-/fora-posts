Although this project is nearly complete (and will hopefully make it in to `cc-release`), I think it has made me see how much `tree` just needs to be replaced with something much, much simpler. 

The simplest explanation for this is that if you go to the `.md` for this very page [`http://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.1.5..01.33.40..2a0e~.md`](http://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.1.5..01.33.40..2a0e~.md) you'll see that it loads pretty quickly.  Even the `.html` loads pretty fast: [`http://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.1.5..01.33.40..2a0e~.html`](http://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.1.5..01.33.40..2a0e~.html).  So, all `tree` is really doing is adding styles and providing a cache so you can quickly navigate between pages.

**And, most importantly: including files.**  As we discussed above, you really should be able to just do a `<kids>` (or, maybe the hoon-like `;kids;`) inside of a `.md` file and have it find the kids and include them in the html.  

Just leaving a note of this here, in case anyone is interested in investigating this area.  I have a feeling we'll be returning to it â€” although other (hopefully, more important) things are consuming our attention in the meantime.
