## `~ravmel-ropdyl`
We developed the es6 branch of tree in tandem with a branch of arvo called `cleaner-http`.  You can find it in Anton's GitHub: [ohaitch/arvo/tree/cleaner-http](https://github.com/ohaitch/arvo/tree/cleaner-http).  

Just boot a fake `~zod` from that, and configure your grunt file to copy your files in there.  The new build system on that es6 branch (for the JS) is much better.
