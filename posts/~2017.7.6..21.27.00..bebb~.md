In an unsurprising turn of events, Urbit has a cool little thing that isn't documented at all, save for a brief mention in the [web apps](https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/web-apps/) part of the Arvo docs.  
The stdlib docs refer to "sail documentation", so let's go and will that into existence!

## Sail syntax?

Sail is Hoon markup for XML. We can use it to shove XML straight into our Hoon code without actually writing the XML itself. Take a little bit of the pain out, you know?

For converting sail code to XML text, we pass it into `++poxo`. Let's start by looking at some stupid examples. (`++poxo` just gives us a flat tape containing the resulting XML. For the sake of readability, I'll be manually formatting those.)

## Tags

Of course, an XML is just boxes within boxes. Let's do something standard and fill an "xml" box with a bunch of "node" boxes.

```
%-  poxo
;xml
  ;node;
  ;node: With text!
  ;node:"Also with text!"
  ;node: Inline code work, too: {<(add 1 2)>}
  ;node
    ; With actual
    ; multi-line text!
  ==
  ;node
    ;node;
  ==
  ;node
    ; We can mix those too.
    ;node;
    ; See?
  ==
==
::  produces:
<xml>
  <node></node>
  <node>With text!</node>
  <node>Also with text!</node>
  <node>Inline code work, too: 3</node>
  <node>With actual\\n
    multi-line text!
  </node>
  <node>
    <node></node>
  </node>
  <node>We can mix those too.\\n
    <node></node>
    See?\\n
  </node>
</xml>
```

It shouldn't be too hard to see the similarities here. We prefix every tag name with `;`, then either close it off with another `;`, put plain text into it with `: my-text` or fill it with more elements, terminated by `==`. These elements can be either more tags, more text, or a combination of both.  
(Multi-line text with `"""` and/or `'''` should apparently also be a thing, but it doesn't seem to get parsed...)

## Attributes

Boxes within boxes are useful, but it'd be cool if we could add custom labels to those boxes. Oh, right, XML attributes.

```
%-  poxo
;example_xml
  ;node(parent "no");
  ;node(parent "no"): With text!
  ;node(parent "yes", kids "1")
    ;node;
  ==
  ;node
      =parent  "no"
      =tall    "definitely";
  ;node
      =parent  "yes"
      =kids    "1"
      =tall    "certainly"
    ;node;
  ==
==
::  produces:
<example:xml>
  <node parent="no"></node>
  <node parent="no">With text!</node>
  <node parent="yes" kids="1">
    <node></node>
  </node>
  <node parent="no" tall="definitely"></node>
  <node parent="yes" kids="1" tall="certainly">
    <node></node>
  </node>
</example:xml>
```

We see that adding attributes is a simple task: just add it between parentheses directly after the tag name. We separate them using `,`. If we're dealing with a longer list of attributes, a "tall form" using `=` might be prettier. It requires a `gap` (two or more spaces) between name and value.  
Also note that namespacing works by using `_` after the tag name. This also works for attributes.

## Shorthands

HTML's kinda popular. And it's XML too! I guess that means we can use sail syntax to describe HTML pages. Turns out there's some familiar shorthands for us to use when doing so. Away with generic and stupid examples, let's build a simple HTML page!

```
%-  poxo
;html
  ;head
    ;meta(charset "utf-8");
    ;title: My first webpage
    ;style/"/bootstrap.min.css"(rel "stylesheet");
    ;style(type "text/css")
      ; #header { font-weight: bolder; }
      ; .bigtext { font-size: 3em; }
    ==
  ==
  ;body
    ;div#outer
      ;h1#header.bigtext: Welcome!
      ;p.bigtext
        ; You are cool!
        ; And so are your friends!
      ==
    ==
    ;script@"http://unsafely.tracking.you/cookiemonster.js";
  ==
==
::  produces:
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>My first webpage</title>
    <style href="/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet"></style>
    <style type="text/css">
      #header { font-weight: bolder; }
      .bigtext { font-size: 3em; }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="outer">
      <h1 class="bigtext" id="header">Welcome!</h1>
      <p class="bigtext">
        You are cool!
        And so are your friends!
      </p>
    </div>
    <script src="http://unsafely.tracking.you/cookiemonster.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

That does look like an actual HTML page. Note how we use the CSS-style shorthands for classes and identifiers, `/` for setting the `href` attribute and `@` for setting the `src` attribute.

## Conclusion

Sail syntax isn't hard, and slightly less awful than raw XML. It's used mainly in [web component](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/maint-20170614/web) Hoon files, and might prove useful in your own development of web front-ends for Urbit.
