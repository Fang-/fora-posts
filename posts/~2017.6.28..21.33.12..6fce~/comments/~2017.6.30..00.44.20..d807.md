## `~taglux-nidsep`
I'm glad you said something about that `~pittyp`, because it solves a problem that `~master-morzod` and I were trying to tackle in talk about a month ago!  Had a bug we couldn't figure out, so we threw molds all over the place and it worked.  We had no idea why.  Early in the program, I used `+7.a` (or something similar).  I guess that must have screwed up the span of `a` (or whatever).  Thanks!
