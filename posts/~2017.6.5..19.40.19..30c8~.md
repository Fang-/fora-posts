In `urbit-meta`, a few of us have been discussing the possibility of a virtual meetup.  `~dabmug-bacner-walwet-narset--taplux-ripmed-tirsyn-watsun` suggested reading the whitepaper, and that seems like a straightforward (if not easy) starting point.

After some back-and-forth, we settled on this Friday (June 9th) at 9 PM EST. I've created a public hangout here: [https://plus.google.com/events/ckfe5da0ehbqjf1a859bt31n9fo](https://plus.google.com/events/ckfe5da0ehbqjf1a859bt31n9fo).

We'll be going as long as far as we can through [http://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf](http://media.urbit.org/whitepaper.pdf).

All are welcome! See you inside!
