Thanks for the feedback. It's my intention to improve the code (and the looks...), comments, github issues and pull requests are all welcome :)

I don't remember exactly when I first found out about Urbit, months ago probably, but I only had time to actually learn hoon in the last month or so.

I took a quick look at the examples repository, and definitely some good stuff there. I will look more deeply when I have more time.

The hardest part after completing some of the simpler examples was probably figuring out how to use %clay. Some things were just a lot of trial and error. I followed a few fora posts and the internals/commentary docs, but some good examples on how to use it (in apps) would have helped (also I can suggest some additional features for %clay, such as storing key-value metadata for objects, so they don't need to be parsed/stored in the object header).

Additionally, I spent some time figuring out how to design the client to work with poke/subscriptions rather than the more common REST style model. A higher level framework for that could be helpful.

One cool thing is that I found out a few features I didn't plan to have just appear there thanks to this model (pages self-updating when changed by another user).
