## `~tonlur-sarret`
This is great feedback and a reminder that poorly phrasing even one sentence can seriously impinge on one's learning experience, especially given all the new terminology of Urbit. We've talked extensively about toning some of this back, but for now, we just have to make our current docs better.

- **0**: It doesn't help that we don't auto-`|mount` your `%home` desk either. This is changing soon. Generally, when we say *pier*, we mean the whole folder containing your ship's stuff. In this case, it's the `mycomet` folder. If you were to mount your `%home` desk, you'd see `/mycomet/home` adjacent to `/mycomet/.urb`. The `.urb` folder is hidden on purpose as that contains your event log and shouldn't directly be tampered with, lest you corrupt your pier.
- **1**: You're right, that is confusing. The way you phrased it is far more clear.
- **2**: I'll ask `~sorreg` about this and get back to you shortly.

We gladly accept pull requests for these kinds of doc improvements! All our docs are just markdown hosted, for now, [on Github](https://github.com/urbit/docs).
