## `~rophex-hashes`
The instance (with a default container optimized image) has about 600MB total, and just running a fresh commet sitting there doing nothing takes most of it (there's about 200MB free). 
I don't know how urbit memory consumption looks like, so it could lock up over time or if you run too many things (I suspect running two urbits on the instance will lock it up). Of course, you can add a swapfile, and then it will be able to work (although it will probably be slow).

I don't know if i'd run a production urbit on it (not sure how resilient the storage is) or expect 100% uptime, but it could be good for testing
