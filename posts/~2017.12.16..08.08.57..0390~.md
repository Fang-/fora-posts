~sorreg made some interesting comments on a now-closed Github issue that I'm copying here for posterity:

```
I feel that the main thing that makes learning Hoon, or any part of Urbit,
difficult for people, is that they feel the system has depths they are
afraid of.  This feeling can be alleviated, but the only real cure for the
disorder is touching the bottom of the river with their own feet.  While it
persists, it makes everything much harder and more stressful.

Some people can swim comfortably without touching the bottom.  Other people
cannot swim.  They can only wade.

There are five main components to understanding Hoon: the data structure
itself, ++hoon; the compiler core, ++ut, and the type system ++type
(formerly ++span); the macro expander ++ap; the model engine ++ax (formerly
++al); and the parser ++vast.

My feeling is that, to be confident with the system at an intermediate
level, you should understand ++hoon, ++ax, ++ap, and ++type, and be
comfortable looking at the source code for these.  It would be nice if ++ap
wasn't dog ugly.  ++ax is clean enough to eat off and ++type is pretty
simple.

++vast is hideous.  ++ut is elegant but intimidating.  These things could
be changed in the long run, but won't be changed soon.

One major confusion right now is the fact that hoons are ++boiled into
tiles (later to become models).  This is just a temporary internal
adaptation measure that hasn't been cleaned up yet.  The parser should
produce ++modls directly.  If you look at ++hoon, you'll see that some
hoons recurse into ++hoon, whereas others have subtrees that are ++root.
These should be ++tile or ++modl.  So, in order to properly explain the
data structure that your code gets parsed into, you have to explain the
concept of a model.

Furthermore, a piece of Hoon that is about to get another pass -- really
the last design pass in developing the language -- is the type
prettyprinter, which needs to be updated for doccords.  In order to improve
our printing of types and typed values, an absolutely crucial aspect of a
programming language, which we are currently quite mediocre at, I intend to
stick some or all ++modls into ++type hints so that they can be used for
printing.

(Imagine if when you typed "ls" in a web terminal, in a folder full of
images, it showed you image thumbnails.  Why shouldn't I be able to ~& a
noun and, if that noun contains an image, see a thumbnail?  I know this is
daring and visionary but it seems like something that ought to be possible
at some point in the 21st century.)

Here is my interpretation of what a model is.

A model is a noun shape.  It's an abstract description of a noun-based data
structure.  It can be used as a macro for generating hoons, in three ways.

One, it can build a mold -- a hoon that produces a gate which accepts any
noun, and produces a correctly-typed instance of the data structure.
Two, it can build a bunt -- a hoon that produces a constant default example
of the data structure.
Three, it can build a test -- a hoon that checks if any noun fits this
model, for pattern-matching.

(In fact, the implementation of ?= *doesn't* use the model directly.  It
makes a bunt and generates Nock, not Hoon, using the type of the bunt.  You
could argue that this is wrong, but fixing it is a low priority.  In any
case, this is the kind of detail that you do want to abstract from the
learner, I think.)

A mold is just an ordinary Hoon gate (function) that works as a
normalizer.  (Hoon is not Coq -- it does not and cannot check this
property.)  You can supply your own mold and use it as an opaque part in a
model.  For instance, if you write [a=foo b=bar], this is a model.  ++ax
takes care of writing the function that accepts * and produces a pair of
foo and bar.  Somewhere else, you wrote ++foo and ++bar, maybe by defining
a model that was used to build a mold.

Suppose ++foo is defined as [x=@ y=@].  Since ++ax does not see the type
system and is just a macro builder, it cannot in any way connect the model
[a=foo b=bar] to the model [x=@ y=@], as models.  But we still want the
behavior of the model [a=foo b=bar] to be exactly the same as the behavior
of the model [a=[x=@ y=@] b=bar].
