Prior art, I think, is seL4. A minimal microkernel with formally defined behavior, much like Arvo. While Arvo builds up to the minimal cpabilities that it needs to be diamond perfect, however, seL4 instead tries to freeze existing semantics in time. It /describes/ the primitives it provides, instead of /defines/ them.
