Howdy martians,

Plato quietly has been undergoing architecture changes - the Urbit <-> Elm connector, which previously was integral part of Plato, has been extracted into a standalone [library](https://github.com/mikolajpp/elm-urbit).

The code is even slightly documented! If you want to write your first Urbit app in Elm, although the road is still rocky, you can have a look at both Plato frontend, and urbit-elm library. 

In the future we will get some tutorials on writing such kind of apps as plato, but in the meantime you have to try it yourself. If you have any questions, feel free to join a newly created channel `~ponmep-litsem/urbit-dev`, with the broad theme of Urbit apps development.
