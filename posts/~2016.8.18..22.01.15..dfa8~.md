Now that we're on the other side of the great renaming it's a bit confusing to figure out who's who.  Or, who was who.

Perhaps everyone can just post their `~old-name` and `~new-name` and we can also update the attribution throughout the forum.

I'm formerly `~talsur-todres`and `~hidseb-pacnet`, now `~wisdyr-holpeg`.
