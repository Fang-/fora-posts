Actually both my Galaxy ~ped as well as ~fosnut-dandut appear to have no ames network and when I tried to start up a new planet (hidmul-palmev) from my unused planets it just hangs on loading the pill.

I tried updating the urbit binary just in case but that didn't help.

Are there some networking issues right now?
