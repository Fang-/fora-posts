There are two versions of the prime-checker: one in Nock, one in Hoon.  The algorithm each uses is basically the same: fairly naive and simple, i.e. not particularly quick or efficient.  One thing I noticed last night was that if I plug too big of a prime number in (or a really really big non-prime), I get the following crash:

    > +prime 22.717
    
    recover: dig: over
    over
    /~zod/home/~2017.4.11..02.06.00..892b/arvo/hoon:<[11.103 15].[11.134 57]>
    /~zod/home/~2017.4.11..02.06.00..892b/arvo/hoon:<[11.104 15].[11.134 57]>
    [and so on, for several lines...]

`~digser` informs me this is an overflow.  I never remember getting overflows when running the Nock version of the prime checker, but the Nock version is much, much slower.  Maybe I never waited around long enough for the overflow to occur when I entered sufficiently large inputs!  So I decided to use the same number, `22.717`, as input for the Nock version and go to sleep for the night.  Lo and behold, the result this morning was `0`.  It performed exactly as desired.

Why would the Hoon program overflow for `22.717` and not the Nock version?  I don't think it's anything about the Hoon code, though perhaps I'm mistaken.  Here it is, once more:

    |=  n/@                  :: n is the input
    =/  i  2                 :: let i = 2
    =/  j  2                 :: let j = 2
    ?:  (lth n 2)  1         :: If n < 2 then return 1, else...
    ?:  (lth n 4)  0         :: If n < 4 then return 0, else...
    |-                       :: Start of loop
    ?:  =((mul i j) n)       :: If (i * j) = n then...
      1                      :: ...return 1, else...
    ?:  =((add j 1) n)       :: If (j + 1) = n then...
      0                      :: return 0, else...
    ?:  (gth (mul i j) n)    :: If (i * j) > n then...
      $(i 2, j (add j 1))    :: Let i = 2, add 1 to j, and loop, else...
    $(i (add i 1))           :: Add 1 to i and loop.

`~digser` supplied me with some neat code that displays the compiled Nock of the Hoon version:

    (~(mint ut -:!>(.)) %noun (ream .^(@t cx+%/gen/prime/hoon)))

The result was the following, which is surprisingly readable:

The resemblance between this code and the manually-written Nock version is significantly greater than I anticipated.  (Hoon really is like a macro-assembler!)  The main difference is in the calls to functions like "mul", "lth", and "gth".  Whereas I had these functions in a manually-written library, this code is making calls to an unseen library, at gigantic tree addresses like `198.669.791` and `25.684.802.300`.  Computationally, however, nothing too difficult seems to be going on.

Any thoughts about the overflows?  Among other things, I'm wondering why dojo handles the Nock version better than the Hoon version.
