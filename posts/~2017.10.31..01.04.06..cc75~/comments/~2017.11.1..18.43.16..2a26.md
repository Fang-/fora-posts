re: terminal file browser

Is this actually wanted? I thought Urbit was explicitly "if you want a UI, use the web". The current sole model is kinda terrible for stuff like this, because there is no ncurses-like mode that you can switch to, so you'd be printing the entire current UI model each time you need an update. Sole is pretty much only append-only right now, instead of something like returning the entire UI each update and diffing.
