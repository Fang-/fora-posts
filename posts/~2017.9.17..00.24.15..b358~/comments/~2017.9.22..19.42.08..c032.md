Holy shit, I never saw jaque before. That is super awesome o.o Also, programming jets in it looks a lot easier than u3...Did you hit a lot of problems with ++ut's Hoon not matching the jets? I seem to remember that you can't /actually/ boot with pure Nock evaluation of the pill because of it, along with being stupidly inefficient without the cache.
