Looking over the neovim API for a moment, what's slightly odd is that when I think of the editor as a *client* for these kinds of functions -- asking an external server to parse a language string, etc -- the neovim developers seem to want the editor to be a *server* that's scripted by an external client.   This would presumably allow the Urbit console to drive a console within nvim, which personally to me is both very emacsy and very uninteresting.  But certainly doable :-)

But regardless of how this flow gets reversed, Urbit isn't really meant to be opening Unix domain sockets or even TCP sockets, or otherwise developing cozy relationships with processes on the same Unix box.  I'm very loath to deviate from the principle that Unix calls Urbit, not vice versa.

This doesn't mean you can't get nvim to highlight your Hoon.  What it does mean is that the relationship seems more proper as a Unix-level relationship between your running Urbit interpreter and your nvim process.  The Python interface is one way to control the Urbit interpreter, but it could get clunky.  But you can also extend vere directly with the nvim API, probably terminating in u3v_wish() -- which lets you do any Hoon computations you want.

It would certainly be fun to implement MsgPack in Hoon, but if you're doing it this way, you can just call someone else's implementation from C.  So unromantic...
