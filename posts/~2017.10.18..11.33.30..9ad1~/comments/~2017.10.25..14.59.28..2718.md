Thank you so much for the video! It helped me make some sense of the language. I have a background as a programmer but haven't worked with that for more than 10 years, and even then I never even knew what a functional programming language was.

I'd like to second ~mastyr's wish for links in the description, also what editor do you use/recommend, how to set up the nice syntax highlighting and that ++ autocompletion for the standard library thing.

Great job!
