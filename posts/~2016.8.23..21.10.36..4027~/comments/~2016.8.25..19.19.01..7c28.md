Thanks for your answer, I impatiently await tomorrow's post!

>Planets can publish a list of well-known fields,

Makes sense. Are those fields supposed to become the standard go-to for displayable information on planets?

>I still think that in most cases, a planet should be displayed as the Urbit name.

Care to elaborate on why you think that? I'd argue that, in the long term, as Urbit dresses itself to become useful to *and used by* a non-technical, non-geeky crowd, "normies", what have you, the (initially perceived) arcanity of ship names will have to be hidden away behind a more "friendly" UI. Planet names aren't like usernames in that you pick them yourself. Even though I may identify as my planet's name, it is not me, not something I created.  
Honestly though, some user research may be valuable here. *What would make for a better user experience for the average end-user?*

Also maybe I'm thinking about this way too simply, but wouldn't the process boil down to "ask planet for its display info/fields over a secure connection (which the network provides)"? What new challenges does this bring that aren't already included in "securely transfer data between nodes in the network"? (Forgive my ignorance.)
