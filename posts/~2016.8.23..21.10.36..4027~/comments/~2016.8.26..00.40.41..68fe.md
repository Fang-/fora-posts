I also want to speak to the comment about "what's best for the normies."

My experience of normies is that, when shopping, they often want something authentic and offbeat.  One can of course go too far with this, but also not far enough.  Urbit is not a grimly useful corporate tool; it definitely has to be interesting, fun, and more than anything else itself.

One way I think about normies is to imagine them as children.  No one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence or maturity of the consumer.  I am not quite ready to give my 8-year-old a planet (or a cellphone) yet.  I do know, however, that at whatever point I assign her a secret spy code name, she will basically shriek with joy.  In some cases, at least, a little bit of mystery and esotericism is a feature, not a bug.  

Of course, this doesn't excuse totally hosing up the usability.  Again, let's make a `who` happen...
