Thanks! I should start numbering...

1. I actually meant `++dill-blit`, not "old" `++blit` (ie, the moves that apps send to `dill`, not the cards that `dill` sends to unix). I currently have `{$pro p/stub}`, `{$klr p/stub}`, and `{$out p/(list @c)}`, and I'm asking if the last two should be combined.

2. What can `++qe` do (or `++tanq` support) to optimize for a certain width? Is the caption supposed to substitute for `$rose` and `$palm` `++tank`s? Are the semantics of `++tanq` similar to what I described?

3. For a styled buffer, do you agree that should be a separate data structure from the actual edited buffer (ie, a presentational substitute, if present)? Or should `lib/sole/hoon` become an operational-transformation-engine for `++stub`?

4. `++styd` as in pluperfect suffix -- "at this point, the buffer has been styled" ... or something like that. `++stye` is definitely superior

#### other points

5. Would it be better to define `++stub` as `(pair styd (list @c))`, and then most use-cases would be `(list stub)`? Kind of nitpicking, but it's strange to write out the inner mold in some of the processing gates.

6. I'm not sure there's a solution available now, I just want to note that semantics of the `++dill-blit` `$hop` branch are different depending on whether ANSI conversion happens in dill or `term.c`.
