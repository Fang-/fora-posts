My general impression is dill.hoon should eat term.c as much as possible¹, for "Arvo is updatable" reasons; I haven't worked extensively with either though, so it might make sense.

¹ And similar for other vanes, e.g. %eyre should at some point do multipart decoding/encoding, which means it'll have to deal with parsing/printing headers anyway, which means the natural interface there is opaque `@t`. Or a stream of `@t`, in the case of incremental requests/responses.
