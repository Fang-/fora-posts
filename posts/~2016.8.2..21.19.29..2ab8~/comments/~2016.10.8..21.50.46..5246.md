Any chance of support for the full 256 console pallet?

This could be done in a way with fallback support for consoles which don't support `ESC[38;5;<fgcode>m` and `ESC[48;5;<bgcode>m` escapes.

While this probably isn't the most elegant way to put it, something like:

    ++  xcolor  @u        :: xterm colors, 0-256
    ++  styl                                        ::  deco/bg/fg/xtermbg/xtermfg
      (pair (unit deco) (qual (unit tint) (unit tint) (unit xcolor) (unit xcolor)))

That would allow for things like:

    [[[~ ~ `%r ~ `167] "foo"] ~]

which would display a lighter red on terminals that supported it while falling back to ansi red on terminals which don't.
