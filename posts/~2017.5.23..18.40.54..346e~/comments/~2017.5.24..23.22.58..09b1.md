## `~tonlur-sarret`
Basically, the network is DDOSing itself. `~zod` is trying to talk to all of the ships that have been booted but are not responding (i.e. ships that have been turned off, that have sunk, or that are offline for any reason), which is delaying other "real" network events. The problem has been quietly getting worse under our nose as this testnet's `~zod` has been up for nine months straight without any serious problems (even we're amazed). We're going to breach the testnet probably next week to fix this issue and a few others that have been causing ships to sink. This will be a minor, much-needed maintenance breach before our larger `cc-release` breach (`urbit-0.5`) in a few months.
