Threads and comments in this forum are broadcasted on talk channels when they're made. As of this post, the ship hosting urbit.org is `~dolhet-nomlup`. To get notifications, simply join the channels `~dolhet-nomlup/posts` for top-level threads, and `~dolhet-nomlup/comments` for comments. These notifications contain both the full text of the post/comment and a URL (the URL will use dolhet-nomlup.urbit.org rather than urbit.org; you can feel free to remove that if you want to get permalinks that use our caching proxy).

The feature is a bit new, and it's presently a bit spammy in webtalk, where we want to display just the URL, but currently show the entire post body in the space meant for the URL! Until we fix that, it'll eventually go away once it scrolls past the top of the screen.

If we switch web ships, you'll have to subscribe to these channels on the new ship. There's a space leak somewhere in eyre that we're working on tracking down; it takes down ships that serve too much web content for too long. This process takes a few weeks, though.
