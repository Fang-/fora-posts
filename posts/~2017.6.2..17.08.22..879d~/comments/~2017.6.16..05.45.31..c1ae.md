A return flight from SF to LA seems to be like a hundred bucks if I order a few weeks in advance... I told myself to stop splurging, because my travel budget is being spent a bit too fast. But there's lots of cool nature to be explored there, even close to the urban areas.

Maybe a bit of a weird/rude question: would anyone in the LA area be able to provide me shelter for like 2-3 nights? I'm not committing to anything yet, just entertaining the idea and curious to know what my options would be.
