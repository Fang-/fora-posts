I've run a minimal docker container and amazingly it managed to run in the f1.micro instance (you can run one such instance for free).

I'm running it in daemon mode with tmux (not the urbit daemon mode) so I can detach and attach to the console at will, and just leave it running.

If anyone is interested, the container and scripts are [here](https://github.com/asssaf/urbit-docker-alpine)
