This looks great and I will run through it later, but let me answer the initial question!

I think our experience is that there are good and bad aspects to working without the normal modern suite of testing and dependency management tools.  Basically the system software equivalent of climbing Half Dome without a rope.  We really are most of the way up Half Dome, so how did we do it at all?

The good aspect is basically that these tools help you manage systems complexity.  Basically, the worst parts of Urbit are also the parts in which not having these tools has cost us significant time and energy.  So is the right approach to build the tools?  Yes, now it is.  

But not having them has been an enormously useful source of discipline, because it creates very unreasonable bounds on the system complexity of Urbit.  Eg, nock.c doesn't need a test harness, and wouldn't benefit from it.  I think the same is true of new Arvo, though I say that before testing it. Most of Urbit doesn't need it, but would benefit from it.  

And then, some of Urbit needs it. :-)  The bad aspect is that when you go climbing without a rope, or at least without putting equipment into the rock every few feet, when you fall you actually fall.  More sensibly, climbing without a rope is a source of good incentives during product design, but the product should be delivered with a rope.

This is a very similar argument to the point I made earlier about syntax modes in editors...
