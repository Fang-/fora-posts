Ah, right. It would need a app to send the Ford moves. There's not really a reason not to use one though, I don't think.

I totally blanked on just including the Hoon file for the app...That's a lot easier. You can totally just compile those /=yourapp=/test files it in the context of the app door, which I didn't realise.
