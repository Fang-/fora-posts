a) comets don't self-update, because until `cc-release` every non-comet has a comet running under it, so zod load scales with /all ships/ and not just "comets"

b) comets report to zod, because when the decision was made, two ships existed: zod, which managed the comets, and doznec, which managed the planets. It is indeed perhaps time to revisit it, esp since "mining" comet addresses is computationally tractable now.
