If by "IP address for ssh" you mean access to the underlying UNIX server, that should work(on public IPs) once we implement Let's Encrypt / dynamic DNS, instead of having *.urbit.org be an alias for ~marzod.

For talking to the urbit itself, `|link` from a comet is the official solution, with the caveat that you don't get any `~&` or stack trace output, nor ^C ^Z etc. a misbehaving computation. `/web/dojo` could probably be ported to run in node as an "ssh" proxy server, but would have the same limitations.
