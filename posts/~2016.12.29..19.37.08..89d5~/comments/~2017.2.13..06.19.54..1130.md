In colhep, you want [a b]~ -> [[a b] ~]

Runes like watpam and bucwut should probably have examples with two subexpressions (`?(a b)`) to quickly show its not just for one.

`^a` might be simpler to explain as simply "resolve variable a, ignoring the first one found"

-/+ and </> are make tons of sense once you remember everything in Hoon are binary trees: +<+ is read as "get the tail of a cell, head of a cell, tail of a cell". We just alternate symbols so that it's easier to read.
