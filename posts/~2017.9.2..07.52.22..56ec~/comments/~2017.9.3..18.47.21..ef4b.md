The first 'real' blog post appeared: http://urbitetorbi.org/urbit/general/2017/09/01/in-personing-digital-you.html

Actually the blog is targeted at fellow urbiters for now, not because of a lack of audience, but I think 
we need to develop our hoon proficiency and way of thinking about urbit in tandem. Let no one be mistaken, Urbit is not what it seems! It is not just 'better way to do unix'. Nor it is just 'land'.
