For now the blog has disabled any indexing by search engines, and for a time I plan to keep it 
only in urbit pioneers circles, as to avoid unnecessary attention. Once our community has benefited from it, I might consider to open it to more general public. Anybody who is seriously interested in urbit will eventually find it anyway. 

For now there are no comments, and I want to avoid using third party such as Disqus (guess urbit already got into my head), but in the future we will want the commenting run on urbit anyway. 

So for now, I hope any discussions that would result from articles could be facilitated here (provided relevant to urbit).
