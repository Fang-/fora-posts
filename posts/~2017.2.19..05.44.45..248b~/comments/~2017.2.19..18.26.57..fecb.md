One, said project is amazing.

Two, if there is just *one* thing I could put in as an advanced format in doccords -- it would be distinguishing between verbal text and code literals, eg using markdown `tec` syntax.  As a writer I would kill for both multiline and single-line literals.  

(It'd also be nice to give users the power of this same format to generate data, not just metadata, of course.  At this point we start adding features madly.  In general I think the powers of structured text should be insanely deeply subsetted -- the set of things Medium lets you do is about right -- but the danger of getting ratholed here is great.)

Two, I'd love to explain but I am not at fault for the ++iny code.  This was written by a certain person with an epizeuctic handle.  Many clever things were done, it looks like, some too clever -- I hope someday there's an obfuscated Hoon contest, but I cannot endorse obfuscated Hoon in our actual codebase.  This sort of thing is unfortunately easier to rewrite than debug.
