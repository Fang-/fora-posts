~lisfet : How did you verify that the sync/merge had occurred? Did you just look at the files from the unix filesystem or did you use +cat from the dojo? 

The reason I ask is because I definitely have seen where a merge does not get fully flushed out to the mounted unix and I had to unmount/mount to have the unix fs reflect the current state of the desk as shown by +cat. That, i do believe, is a bug though I did not thoroughly document or submit it.
