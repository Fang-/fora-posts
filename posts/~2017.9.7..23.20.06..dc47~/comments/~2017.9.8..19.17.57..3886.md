~marsyp : unfortunately %clay doesn't always play nice with unix symlinks. it seems to work fine when you just update the linked-to file (it updates in %clay) but deleting either the link or the linked-to file results in %clay being out-of-sync with the unix fs and it doesn't notice it. my experience, ymmv.
