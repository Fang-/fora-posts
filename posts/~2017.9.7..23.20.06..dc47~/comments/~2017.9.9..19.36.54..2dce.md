## `~rophex-hashes`
I've tried symlinks too and it didn't work well, also feels kludgy.
In fact having to mount a desk to unix just so I can install an app feels kludgy. Urbit should be a able to fetch the files for you.

I'm thinking about ~sorreg's idea about using desk ancestry for dependencies and going back to a stateless solution.

Let's say I want to install an app called app with a dependency called lib1.
So the algorithm is:

1. see if there is a desk named xyz-app (xyz is just a user configurable prefix to avoid clashes with non-package desks) - If it exists, we're done. 
2. otherwise look for a desk named xyz-lib1 - if it exists, go to 4
3. create desk xyz-lib1 from %base and install lib1's files in it
4. create desk xyz-app from xyz-lib1 and install app's files in it

I'm thinking whether just having a desk with that name is enough, or whether we should check the hash of the root of the tree in clay to make sure that the desk actually contains the package (and in case of multiple versions of a package maybe look for the commit in the commit history). This works like other functional package managers where a package is a function of all its files and dependencies.
