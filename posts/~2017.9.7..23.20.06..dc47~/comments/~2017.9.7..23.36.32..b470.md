Damn ~rophex, you sure have been doing work!

I totally agree. As anyone who has done any work at all on the Urbit stack can confirm, reinventing the wheel is a long and tedious process. And the broadness of Hoon's standard library will hopefully keep this from spiraling into npm levels of micro-dependencies.  
Now for me to start writing my code more generically and have it be actually useful.

This is really cool though. I see projects like these as significant steps on Urbit's path towards being a mature ecosystem. Granted, this should maybe be bundled into the system, but this is a great shot towards that.
