## `~rophex-hashes`
I've started implementing the desk-merge approach in the [ancestry branch](https://github.com/asssaf/urbit-package/tree/ancestry).

Each dependency gets installed into its own desk and they all get merged into their dependent's desk. This allowed removing the manifest from the app state. 

I use a hash in package.json to verify the package has been installed (this hash is of the merged desk so it means that all the dependencies must be frozen).

Right now I'm just overwriting the desk if it already exists (and contains some other version). I'm still thinking of how to improve this:

1. Sync every commit from git into the desk in order
2. Sync versions as needed (but they won't be in order). Use desk labels to find versions so they are not recommitted multiple times.

Approach 1 will obviously work only for something like git and not any generic url. Also, downloading the entire history just to install the latest version might not fit everyone's needs.

Approach 2 is generic and only downloads versions as needed, but they will be committed in random order (as they are pulled).
