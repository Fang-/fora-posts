Hello, all.  If you've been dreaming of being able to send someone a text message from inside your Urbit, today your dreams have come true.

<https://github.com/famousj/UrbitSMS>

All the instructions are in the README.

That's the good news.  The bad news is that being able to receive a text message is a work in progress (and probably more work than this was).

Also possibly of interest, I made some notes describing the trials and tribulations of getting this thing up and running, also in the README.

If you have any questions/comments/suggestions, please let me know.
