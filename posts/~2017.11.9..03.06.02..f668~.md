`~tonlur` gave me some tips after I created my first fake zod:

```
~taglux-nidsep+ i am ~zod!
~taglux-nidsep+ albeit fake
~taglux-nidsep+ thanks ~tonlur
~tonlur-sarret+ of course.
~tonlur-sarret+ try out the new mold syntax to make sure you're not

~tonlur-sarret+ hallucinating:
~taglux-nidsep+ yup
~taglux-nidsep+ it works
~taglux-nidsep+ i have new hoon!
~tonlur-sarret+ sweet.

~tonlur-sarret+ also the , syntax
~tonlur-sarret+ for manually switching between "value" and "pattern" modes.
~taglux-nidsep+ wait, what's the , syntax?
~tonlur-sarret+ ,~ ,%foo ,[@ ^]
~tonlur-sarret+ equals 153

~tonlur-sarret+ $~ $foo {@ ^}
~taglux-nidsep+ ah
~taglux-nidsep+ sweet
~tonlur-sarret+ when you're not in "pattern mode", i.e. defining a gate sample,
~tonlur-sarret+ casting, etc.

~tonlur-sarret+ basically you need a way to distinguish ~ or %foo the value and
~tonlur-sarret+ ~ or %foo the mold.
~tonlur-sarret+ actually "noun mode" and "mold mode" is probably better, to keep
~tonlur-sarret+ things consistent.
~taglux-nidsep+ makes sense

~mastyr-bottec+ glad you're explaining this here
~mastyr-bottec+ why is buc getting axed? :)
~tonlur-sarret+ the classic example is:
~taglux-nidsep+ is it?
~mastyr-bottec+ well it is for denoting molds here

~tonlur-sarret+ `=+ a=@ a`
~tonlur-sarret+ `=/  a=@  42  a` 
~tonlur-sarret+ in the first example, you're literally wrapping the face `a`
~tonlur-sarret+ around the atom mold, treated as just a noun.
~tonlur-sarret+ in the second, you're specifying that 42 is of mold @.

~tonlur-sarret+ but both use the `a=@` literal syntax.
~tonlur-sarret+ the hoon parser knows to treat example 1 as "noun mode" and
~tonlur-sarret+ example 2 as "mold mode".
~taglux-nidsep+ yeah that's just a function of the =/ versus =+ syntax
~tonlur-sarret+ actually a simpler example where this manifests

~tonlur-sarret+ is [@ @] versus ,[@ @] .
~mastyr-bottec+ hmm, how is [@ @] ever used if not as a mold?
~tonlur-sarret+ or the buc example:
~taglux-nidsep+ i still see $ as working in my fake zod
~tonlur-sarret+ %foo ,%foo

~taglux-nidsep# ($foo 1)  %foo
~tonlur-sarret+ yes, 153 syntax isn't deprecated.
~tonlur-sarret+ because we still need to port our whole codebase.
~mastyr-bottec+ that will be fun
~tonlur-sarret+ yup!

~mastyr-bottec+ hold on though re: [@ @]
~mastyr-bottec+ where could that be used if not as a definition of a mold?
~tonlur-sarret+ ~mastyr buc getting axed just fits into the general theme of
~tonlur-sarret+ this change,
~tonlur-sarret+ which is that it's a terrible ui to have two syntaxes for

~tonlur-sarret+ constructing stuff.
~tonlur-sarret+ you're right that it's hard to think of an example where
~tonlur-sarret+ something like that is used in the wild right now,
~tonlur-sarret+ but hoon being a general-purpose language, that doesn't mean
~tonlur-sarret+ there shouldn't be a way to do that.

~tonlur-sarret+ :-(mold-1 mold-2)
~taglux-nidsep# ($123 15)  %123
~tonlur-sarret+ versus
~tonlur-sarret+ $:(mold-1 mold-1)
~tonlur-sarret+ $:(mold-1 mold-2)*

~taglux-nidsep+ i guess it should be (,%123 15)
~tonlur-sarret+ (,%123 15) returns %123, yes.
~mastyr-bottec+ the first is a cell of molds
~mastyr-bottec+ the second is a mold from a tuple
~tonlur-sarret+ exactly.
