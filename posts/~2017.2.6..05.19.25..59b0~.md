Howdy, I'm ~taglux-nidsep posting from a comet because I'm having trouble with my web console:

https://taglux-nidsep.urbit.org/

Visiting that link should produce a rather ugly error, unreadable to a lowly noob like me.  Checked with "+cat /=home=/web/md" and everything looks fine.  Once upon a time I'd had a fake blog set up and it worked, but that was several updates ago.

Any ideas?
