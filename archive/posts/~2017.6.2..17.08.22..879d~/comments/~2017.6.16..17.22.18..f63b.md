Hey folks, sorry if this is a redundant post, trying to respond here via my comet and not sure if it's working. 

I'm down to host a meetup at my place in the LBC. Big backyard situation that would be cool to grill in. I'm also down to meet anywhere else in the LA area. Just thought Long Beach might be central for both LA, South Bay, and OC folks.

~palfun-foslup I may be able to host you depending on the dates you're referring to.
