*Update* 

I forgot the fetching over `%ames` happens between `%home` desks anyways, so the `%feed-desk` thing doesn't really matter (unless you still want to keep the frontend code separated from your `%home`). 

So in order for this to run on your existing planet or comet (*booting a brand new planet or comet from latest maintenance will work perfectly, and you don't need to folllow these steps), you need your `%home` desk to be updated to latest Arvo maintenance.

** Important! ** Entering the following command will overwrite any web files, generators, code etc. that isn't part of standard Arvo. So if you have a blog, Keybase files, generators etc. in your %home desk that you want to save, either save those somewhere on Unix or just `|merge` them to a new `%saved-files` desk or something.

Okay, so to get this working on your planet and prevent `%gall` crashes, in `:dojo`:
```
> |merge %home (sein our) %kids, =gem %init
```

This will re-initialize your `%home` desk based off latest maintenance Arvo. And if all the ships you want to subscribe to also do this, this UI should work!

Let me know if you get any crashes or have any other problems! I'll be on pretty much all of tonight, and will be around midday tomorrow and Friday as well.

You're also more than welcome to message me directly in `:talk`, or send me an email with feedback at `<my first name ^>@tlon.io`.

Thanks again! Have fun poasting.
