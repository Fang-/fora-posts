## `~tonlur-sarret`
`~tonnum`:

1. To my knowledge, no; `~taglux's` ship broke because he didn't get the update for other reasons, but the update didn't directly cause his `:feed` to break down.
2. I think `git clone`ing the repo effectively does that. Someone may have seen a `%clay` bug if they copied these in directly while their ship was running (as noted in the OP, in general it's a good idea to turn a ship off when importing a large amount of new files).
3. After an attempted fresh home desk init, one can `diff` their `eyre.hoon` and/or `gall.hoon` in their home desk's `arvo` repo against the one in [latest maintenance](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/maint-20160818/arvo) to look for any differences.
