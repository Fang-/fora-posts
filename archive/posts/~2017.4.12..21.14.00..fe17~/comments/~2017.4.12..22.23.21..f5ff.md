Ayy finally! This is cool, y'all should subscribe to `~palfun-foslup` for some high-quality microblogging.

(It took some fiddling for me to get this to work. It's important your `%home` desk it also up to date with maintenance because this requires some recent fixes in `%gall` apparently, which is still loaded and run from the home desk.)

It's cool to finally have a real application built on top of talk. Talkbot sort of just slurps whatever's already there, but this makes actual innovative use of the framework/platform talk provides! Great stuff!

With this, the tutorial, and incoming talk improvements combined, I can't wait to see what people will be building on top of it. Let this be a catalyst for more development!
