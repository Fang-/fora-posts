Hey `~lodhul`. Did you also follow the step in my *Update* comment after the post? If not that's 3 people who haven't, so I'll go in and update these Fora instructions at some point soon. Basically, just make sure you're on latest maintenance. I'm not sure why you would have a syntax error in your `%eyre` unless either you have an old copy somehow or you were playing with it / fixing some other `%eyre` bug manually yourself.
