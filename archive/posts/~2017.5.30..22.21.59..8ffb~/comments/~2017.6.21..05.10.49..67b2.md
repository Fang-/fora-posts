Imagine though, if we could "sell" by just being a good product. I know popular opinion says that's practically unheard of these days, but let's be real, there are still exceptions. Urbit in its final form is no doubt a good enough product to do that, and if we can pull that aspect into the preliminary forms then we're good to go.  
Besides, the future isn't scary, so it shouldn't be shocking people.
