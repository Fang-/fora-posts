I tried telling some of my friends about Urbit. Some asked questions, some accepted that they're not techie enough for it.  
I showed the sale videos to my parents. My mom was surprised my dad didn't get all of it, and everyone accepted it's not for them yet.

Urbit itself shouldn't be the thing that gets non-tech people into Urbit. It's the things you can do with it that should be focussed on. Instead of explaining what Urbit is, we should be explaining what The Urbit World looks like.  
A world where you're not going from one social media platform to the next, but instead have it all in one place. A world where password fatigue is a thing of the past, because you have only one online identity to worry about. A world where you're *actually* connected to your friends. A world where spammers and trolls don't exist, and you can easily filter out content you don't want to see.

Depending on your audience it may be wise to avoid "you own all your data so privacy" argument, because believe it or not there are people who go beyond not caring into "why would you care, you dangerous nutter?"  
But if your audience is privacy-minded, definitely include that.
