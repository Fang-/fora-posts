I found myself giving a VC colleague of mine an Urbit elevator pitch the other day, and this is what I came up with, am I someway off the mark?

"My understanding of it so far is as a decentralised virtual machine but not like Ethereum. Ethereum is essentially one single main frame that users pay for time shares of. In Urbit you have your own machine which is decentralised along with all the other users' machines. A few components go into making this up including a decentralised namespace management system (galaxies, stars, planets, moons, etc) akin to DNS."
