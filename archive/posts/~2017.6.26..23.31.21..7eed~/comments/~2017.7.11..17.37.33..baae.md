## `~master-morzod`
I've poked around at this a little bit, and I can't get it to work either. I can watch specific files and receive their contents on update, but an `%x` care simply doesn't work recursively (with `%next` or otherwise). Whether this is a bug or by design I'll have to leave to the experts.

And I can't think of any other way to implement this, short of recursively enumerating a directory with `%y` and watching every file within. The inability to request commit metadata looms large.
