Right, that's pretty close to what I tried initially that led to stack overflow when compiling kernel vanes. (I was pulling +6 from the clam instead of kicking it, but that's certainly not going to lead to any *more* recursion.) It amounts to declaring ++clam as

```
^-(twig [%gasp [%like [%bust %noun] bunt] (whip(gom 7) 6)])
```

If I edit that into hoon.hoon, I get an overflow while compiling %behn. I can't properly test it with a standalone copy of the compiler, because an un-modified un-jetted ++ut runs out of stack compiling %behn anyway. But I don't *think* the :reset overflow is a simple jet invalidation thing, since I can toss

```
=.  p.sec  =>((flop p.sec) ?>(?=(^ .) .))
```

into ++whip's kelp and fern cases without anything going haywire.

Maybe it's an unrelated issue. I hope so, because just calling ++bunt for the clam sample is as clean as it gets. Unfortunately, it still doesn't address the problem with ++tanq, since you can't know which cell components are actually recursive at macro expansion time. Still, it might be possible to handle it there if we adopted a mold restriction like "no direct recursion in the head of a cell", and changed ++whip to generate unit-valued normalization for non-default cases. Then it could fail fast if the head fails to normalize before trying the tail.
