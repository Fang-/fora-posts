Desired properties of bunts:

- bases bunt to `0`, except `^` which bunts to `[0 0]`
- constant molds bunt to their constants
- autocons molds bunt to the cons of their bunts
- forks bunt to the bunt of the first element of the fork
- herbs and/or random gates bunt to a `^~`ed kick of the gate
- clams (defined as molds that exist as gates past macro expansion) to produce the bunt when kicked
- clams to produce the bunt when slammed on a value of wrong span
- unbunts to produce the mold of whatever the value typechecks as, except with the bunt replaced with that value, and to follow the above clam properties

The sample can be anything as long as the above works, but it's an obviously good place to store the bunt.
