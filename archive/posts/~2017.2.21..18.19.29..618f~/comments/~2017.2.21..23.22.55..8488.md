Oh well, perils of being early I suppose. Glad to hear it's fixed in future. I'll not bother galen and just make do with comets to learn on right now as I have star anyway and, once I'm confident I can't kill my star by mistake, I'll just ticket my own planet I suppose :) 

So is cc-release going to be a continuity breach and therefore sider-salbex can ride again but in virgin form afterwards?  TBH I'm not entirely sure why it can't be recreated now... would the network messages have the wrong "magic numbers" (for want of a better term) due to the state being out of sync and therefore no messages get routed... sort of thing?
I feel I'm still missing a key concept or two here ( I'm old and set in my ways :) )
