I echo that `^:` reminds me of cells, and should probably echo the `#` used to invoke it; also, it's kinda weird to have the documentation /only/ in the type-level dump from the compiler, not even output with a nock 10. Walking spans in general is pretty terrible, imo.

Re: pretty-printing gate types - we throw away the source code's name for spans. The type pretty printer is operating solely on pattern matching, which is why it's kinda shitty. Spans are parsed directly into the AST, so adding the string that's responsible is hard. I looked into how to get around to doing this, and it would be a mess: Right now all the `$` runes are the same as any other twig parsing, and there's no context kept while the compiler is parsing to tell what code they are under. Something like `|=  {a/@ b/@}  (add a b)` is just parsed as "we have `|=`, now parser two twigs and emit a %gate", with `{a/@ b/@}` being parsed as an irregular form of %bank that operates exactly the same way. While parsing types aren't treated any differently than expressions.
