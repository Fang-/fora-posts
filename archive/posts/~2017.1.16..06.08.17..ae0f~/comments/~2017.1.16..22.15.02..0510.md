`^` actually seems correct since these are a type-level construct, while the `~` category implies a nock `10`. Having the arm parser look for a leading doc cord messes with arity in a confusing way, but is probably still fine; you could also do something like `'''^`...`'''^` as the irregular/only form of `^:  '''`.
