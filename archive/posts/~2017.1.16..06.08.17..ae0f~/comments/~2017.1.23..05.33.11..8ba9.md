## `~ponnys-podfer`
Removed the manual `[%hold ...]` parsing. Now uses `++play:ut` to get the span of the hold. Handles axis addressing (`# +2047`), requesting a specific gate's docs (`# add`), and the loadable library case (`/+  string`, `# string`, `# sum:string`).

Things left undone:

- Still using `#` instead of thinking about how to integrate this into `?`.

- `++mull` is still broken, and the naive fix crashes vere.

- Haven't implemented a toplevel help.

- Other than a single cord, what goes in `{$docs ...}`? Right now, I'm doing minimal parsing, just to make sure the output handles newlines gracefully in the arbitrarily large doccords. My only plan was to put the first line (truncated to the 80th column) in the core overview.
