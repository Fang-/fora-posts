Can we perhaps get a fixed name for a branch that represents the latest version - whatever is required to interoperate with the live network?
I've been running such semiautomated ships, under the assumption that urbit/vere code changes cannot cause incompatibility within the network, except at announced breaches, or with the rare bug. I thought that property was something one could get from urbit's self-updating etc. design.
