Hi all,

I'm interested in putting together a Swift library which can talk to an Urbit app from within an iOS application.

I was wondering if anybody could help me understand how to make a basic HTTP request to Urbit? (i.e., what endpoint I should be pointing at, how to get an authentication token and what to do with it, etc...)

My main reference so far is http://urbit.org/docs/using/web/ (and the mentioned urb.js), but my JavaScript is a little rusty these days...
