Hey! Being able to get email update with arbitrary content is definitely a good idea.

A small application which you can tell "if some circle receives a message, email that message to me" is definitely on the to-do list, and fairly high up too. We want something like this to accompany the forum/blog/notes management thing we're currently working on. Really all it has to do is connect to hall and then call an email API when it sees new messages. We already have a gmail API connector, but I'd love to put in one for a non-Google email service as well.
