Update: After using the previous system for a bit, ~pittyp pointed out that including the git branch in the pill URL was painful whenever git wasn't firmly on a branch, such as after reverting a commit. Partly due to frustration with the pill workflow, he built a CI for Urbit that handles pills more intelligently.

The CI now makes a new pill whenever there's a commit on the master branch of urbit/arvo that modifies the sys/ directory. Changing a file anywhere else in Arvo doesn't require a new pill, so this approach maintains consistency without excessive work. I made a corresponding change in vere so that when you use the `-s` flag to start an Urbit, it uses git to find the most recent commit that changed the sys/ directory, within the ancestry of the Arvo folder specified with `-A`.

In practice, this means instead of needing to manually create and upload a pill with each change to Arvo, you should only need to make a new one when modifying system files, and when launching an Urbit using `-s`, it should be able to find a pill reliably under most circumstances.

This new scheme is live for development starting at the following commits: [urbit/urbit](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/tree/5abae22b6cd6e577372e5484ee942f16d8abf667) [urbit/arvo](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/tree/a0120e7bd2c529fbd42946bf0f2b33c8d69c95ff)
