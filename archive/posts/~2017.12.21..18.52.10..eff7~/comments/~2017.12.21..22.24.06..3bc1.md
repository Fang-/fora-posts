Pretty good! A few notes:

- The current network 'constitution' has not yet been committed to the Ethereum blockchain. The galaxy table is public here: [https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/sys/vane/ames.hoon](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/sys/vane/ames.hoon). You can see our Ethereum contracts here: [https://github.com/urbit/constitution](https://github.com/urbit/constitution). They're currently being audited.

- The network is actually fairly evenly distributed. Founders / early employees (about six people, I think) own about 17% of the network. The company owns about 53%, with 18% explicitly set aside to fund core infrastructure development. The rest is owned by early contributors, investors, and buyers in public sales. 

- It's true that Galaxies are intended to be the senate. They vote on kernel updates, and are the primary governing bodies. Stars are intended to be the congress â€” a kind of check on the power of the Galaxies. Stars also distribute software updates / do routing, so they're an important part of the governance process. Both Stars and Planets can change parents.
