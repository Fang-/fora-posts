With the new event loop, where there's a worker process that runs the events collected, is it possible to have event timeouts now? I've mentioned multiple times how much I'd love a try-it-online Hoon site, but it's not feasible right now. A type of %ford poke with a time limit would fix that, along with any other general "run arbitrary code" or other pokes that might want to be limited (app DOS from computation-hard requests, limit on the time waiting to dereference the global namespace or talk to a ship...)
