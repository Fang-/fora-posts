For me, I discuss that urbit is an attempt to rebuild the entire infrastructure of computing from the ground up using the lessons we have learned in the last 40 years instead of just continuing
to pile more layers on top of a decaying, fundamentally insecure and broken infrastructure.

I talk about how annoying spam and viruses are and that they are impossible to eliminate and only getting worse using the current, flawed computing infrastructure and that we need a new one to deal with it.
