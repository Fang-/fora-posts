I have three approaches, depending on my read of the person's concerns/interests.

- For the person who likes all of their services, but finds it exhausting.
  - "Urbit manages the relationships with all of your services so that you'll never have to remember a password again."
- For the person who prizes security
  - "Do you ever wonder what would happen if Gmail went away? Urbit is your liferaft."
- For the adventurous
  - "Urbit is the undiscovered country."
