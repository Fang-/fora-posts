Hmmm, that probably *shouldn't* work, since we don't have proper Hoon sandboxing yet. I imagine an infinite loop would crash /fora when it tries to render the page to HTML :/ This is technically just a `:talk` channel, so the proper way to execute code would just to have the web interface support `#` telegrams, since that is evaluated on your own ship.

I've wanted a `++mock` that only runs through n reductions before failing for a while now, so we can have a tryitonline-like public REPL...
