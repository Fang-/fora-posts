> does this PKI scheme then mean that Ethereum addresses become the primary way to identify Urbit owners?

The Urbit network itself doesn't care for the Ethereum addresses at all. It just cares that you, as a ship's owner, have a private key to match the public key as defined in the PKI. Practically, you will need a way to change this key-pair (for example, if it ever gets compromised). For this, the ship in the PKI has an Ethereum address associated with it as its "owner", and only that owner is allowed to perform operations like rekeying the ship.
