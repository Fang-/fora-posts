~sigmes, you are correct: Tlon is a single point of failure. But Tlon is also a corporation and has a physical address, public presence, list of employees, communication channels that don't involve smart contracts.

~docmeb, perhaps you misunderstood my concern, which is decidedly not with ECDSA breaking. What I am concerned with is a bug in the contract being exploited which transfers control of my Urbit identity from the ECDSA key I control to some anonymous ETH address. In that case what recourse do I have to prove that I am still the owner of my ship? I for one would like to protect my own identity and property; I don't trust blockchains to prove ownership of anything but tokens on that given blockchain, and given its track record my trust in Ethereum is nil.
