Quick, simple question before I get into this more, an apology for not using my urbit, ~tindus-milmus:

Did you consider anything in-between where you are (Github, database, insecure keys, test net) and where you're going (decentralized blockchain)? Your desire to use "21st-century tools" is vague, and Ethereum is highly-questionable technology. Is there any real requirement at this point to run on a quasi-decentralized blockchain? And I know I'll get abused for suggesting the following, but did you consider running your own private Ethereum blockchain on a cloud provider like https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/blockchain, as a more reasonable step in the direction? What is the advantage of running on the Ethereum main public network?
