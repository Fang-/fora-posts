If we want to actually initialize the network and use real keys the choice is between Urbit's native crypto and some other cryptosystem.  Tlon can't manage the identities issued by other third parties.  That's what the PKI is for.

Using Urbit itself means using unaudited, unproven crypto.  As far as I understand it, all our c-level crypto uses reference implementations â€” but it's quite a risk to initialize this system without a lot of both testing and uptime.  In the case that we deploy a live Urbit network we have to trust the *entire* system.  This approach allows us to factor out the PKI.

Our work in progress contracts are public, and we will get them thoroughly audited before deploying them.  The risk of them being exploited is something we take quite seriously.
