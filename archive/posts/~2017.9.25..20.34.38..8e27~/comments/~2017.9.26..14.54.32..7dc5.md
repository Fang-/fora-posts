JFY, "tooling support -- in software, hardware, vaulting, exchanging, etc" is exactly same for ETC and ETH. People just use same tools, because they are made for Ethereum, and it doesn't matter if it's ETH or ETC fork of it. It's 100% compatible technologies, at least until ETH will move to Proof of Stake.
