Hey there! Right now we're working out some issues with these. We talked about this a bit in this recent Fora post:

http://urbit.org/fora/posts/~2017.4.17..04.07.40..a663~/

There's a temporary workaround in that post. But also if you happen to be a savvy C hacker (or know someone who is), we've laid out some extra details and a starting point to actually dive into the C HTTP code and fix this for good!

Thanks! Hope that helps. Gotta love alpha software.
