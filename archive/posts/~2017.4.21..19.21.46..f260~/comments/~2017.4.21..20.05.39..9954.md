## `~pittyp-datfyn`
If you mean requests, *to* apps, see the [web app docs](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/web-apps/), `%eyre` acts as a server for a JSON api.

As far as callbacks/responses, the interface is: a `[ost=bone %sigh /my/callback/disambiguator request-data]` move eventually turns into a call to the `++sigh` callback with an argument of `[/my/callback/disambiguator response-data]`; or a `++sigh-my-callback` etc. if (part of /) the routing is hard-coded. The [arvo internals](http://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/) page has more details on how this is arranged; in summary, anything with a callback-disambiguator `wire` is a `%pass` event that sticks said `wire` into a list of causes, anything without a `wire` is a `%give` event that is routed according to the topmost `wire`, this structure is maintained through various data transformations. When the bottom `wire` is hit, you get an externally visible event, lines printed to the screen, or json being sent/received over http, or UDP packets routing talk messages; much of the work the kernel modules do is keeping around opaque descriptors used to correlate events concerning the outside world with their causes.
