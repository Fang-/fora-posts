Speaking as someone who's probably mid-way between uber geek and your computer illiterate grandpa, the friendly command line looks great.  Seems like it would retain all the flexibility and control for power users and I think (as long as there are good tutorials to ease people into the idea) may be *less* confusing for newbies.  In that it has one place to go and one process of interaction instead of "now which icon do I need to click?, or was it in that menu thingy?"  etc., etc. 
Looking forward to see what 2017 brings to the Urbit universe. 

BTW, I know they are just screen shots, but I'm curious how you picked ~hocten in Galen's /talk/me screen, 'cause I believe that's my star :)
