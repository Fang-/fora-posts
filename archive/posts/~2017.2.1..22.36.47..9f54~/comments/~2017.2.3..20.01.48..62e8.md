I agree wholeheartedly that the command line can be scary, but I think that `~tinden-pontev` makes the simplest point on this front: figuring out what icons to click on can also be really confusing.  I found this passage from the Stephenson essay we reference particularly good: [https://twitter.com/galenwolfepauly/status/824791956169519104](https://twitter.com/galenwolfepauly/status/824791956169519104).  

I like to think of the audience for this kind of thing as being half systems geeks and half Snapchat users.  I'd love it if Urbit could be equally exciting to both.  It may seem crazy, but I do think that's possible.

Apologies for not being more communicative over the past few months.  As I said to someone on `:talk` the other day: we're often the most productive when we're the least vocal.  It's a bad habit though, and one we're going to break.

Glad you like it!  I have no idea how I picked `~hocten`.  Wait, actually, I think you were showing up in the logs on one of our servers one day and it just stuck in my mind.
