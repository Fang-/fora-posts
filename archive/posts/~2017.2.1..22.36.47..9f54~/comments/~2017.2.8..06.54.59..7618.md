Guys nice job but I would appreciate it if you made it clearer how I can start using this system. Do I have to spin up my own server? Or is there a cloud-based server I can log into? 

With respect to Hoon, it's clear you guys put tons of work into it, so it's a shame that the totally language used to describe it -- subjects/verbs/etc. -- is so orthogonal to normal CS terms. I program in C++, studied Maths + CS, and am familiar with a reasonably large variety of languages (including lisp), and yet I struggle to follow the docs. Would it be so hard to phrase docs in terms we're familiar rather than forcing us to look it up each time? I understand your argument that the meanings aren't quite the same, but you could just show a box saying -- "hey, this isn't really a one-to-one mapping". There are enough similarities, in particular to lisp, for at least a tutorial that adopts the classic atom/car/function/macro etc. notations.

I'd love to use this... but I haven't the foggiest clue how! Help me :)
