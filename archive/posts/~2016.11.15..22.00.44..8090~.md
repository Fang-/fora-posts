Urbit's CLI experience isn't the prettiest right now. Output from dojo, talk and whatever else you may have running come together in one big stream. So, I asked,

```
~palfun-foslup+ q: on a scale of hello world to rewritting %dill, how hard would
~palfun-foslup+ it be to implement multiple "contexts"/"windows" for console
~palfun-foslup+ apps to reside within? ie ctrl-x acting lik a tmux window switch
~sorreg-namtyv+ we've thought about this extensively
~sorreg-namtyv+ it's clearly more or less the way things should work, though
~sorreg-namtyv+ scrollback is important
~sorreg-namtyv+ but you can switch contexts on the visible screen
~sorreg-namtyv+ and mix up the scrollback
~sorreg-namtyv+ anyway, it would have a fair amount of crossover with vere
~sorreg-namtyv+ and require a bit of c skillz
[...]
~sorreg-namtyv+ basically the interface between %dill and vere would need
~sorreg-namtyv+ to be redesigned
~sorreg-namtyv+ galen also envisions another line which is a tab list
~sorreg-namtyv+ so the feedback isn't invisible
```

The "tab list" design mentioned is pretty close to what I imagine, and something that will probably be necessary once people start running more CLI apps than just the default two.

Cue discussion about design, implementation, etc. I specifically am curious about how this would be implemented, concretely, even though it may be a bit early to think about that.
