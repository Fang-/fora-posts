Regarding rune docs, the URL's aren't the only things where using non-rune names are confusing.  
Frequently, in a rune's "Discussion" section, I see only the `:rune` notation used. Some are really obvious, but for others I have no idea what the runic equivalent is. We should either use both, or stick to runic notation entirely.

(Heh, when I just started out I never thought I'd suggest banishing `:rune` notation from (part of) the docs.)
