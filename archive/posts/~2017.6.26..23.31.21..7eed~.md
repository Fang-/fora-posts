All, 

I posted some time ago about trying to watch a dir from a gall app. After much futzing, I had it figured out. Turns out that I had not.

Behold, this code
```
|%
  ++  card  {$warp wire sock riff}
  ++  move  {bone card}                        
--                                                            
!:                                                         
|_  {hid/bowl state/$~}                          
::  watch-dir
++  watch-dir
  |=  a/path
  ^-  (list move)
  =/  soc/sock
    [our.hid our.hid]
  =/  rav/rave
    [%next %z da+now.hid a]
  =/  rif/riff
    [%home [~ rav]]
  =/  car/card
    :^
      %warp
      a
      soc
      rif
  [[ost.hid car] ~]
::
++  poke-noun
  |=  a/path
  ^-  (quip move +>.$)
  [(watch-dir a) +>.$]
  ::
::
++  writ
  |=  {way/wire rot/riot}
  ~&  [%rot rot]
  [(watch-dir way) +>.$]
--
```
It was only recently that I realized (with ~master and ~pittyp's help) that the `riot` returns a hash of the dir `dome`, in lieu of the node which has changed. Give that I'd like to know _which_ file changed, I attempted to change the `care` of my `rant` to `%x`. This appears to immediately return an empty riot, which triggers a rewatch according to my code, which loops aggravatingly forever. 

Is there something I'm missing? Any help would be appreciated.
