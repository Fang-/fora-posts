Hey ~samsef, that was me on `urbit-meta`. On further reflection, I was wrong: you can unlink `:talk` from the console and it will no longer output messages: `|unlink %talk`. The web UI will still work. You won't be able to use `:talk` from the terminal at all, unless you `|link %talk`, which will start the output back up as well.

I guess I was thinking of some nonexistent intermediate feature, where you could pause `:talk` output while using `:dojo` ...

There's an old daemon mode in Urbit, but I don't think it works right now.
