Just chiming in to say that improving the console has been the missing link for me in the Urbit stack for the last year or so.

muxing is cool, what I truly want to see is an idiomatic way to build console apps. I've accepted (grudgingly) that something more finessed than raw VT-100 escape sequences is needed. 

I look forward eagerly to building curses-type applications in Urbit, and am willing to help. My Hoon is...not great. But I do understand the VT-100 command set pretty thoroughly. Writing my own mini-curses is my go-to project for learning a new language. Which may explain why my Hoon is not so great.
