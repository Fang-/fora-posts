Instead of reinventing the wheel, we already have tmux, which already does everything you might be thinking in terms of tabs, and then some.  However, to make this possible, you would need a way to launch multiple instances.  Might want to take a look at urb, which lets you run one-liners from the command line

On the other hand, if you want to get your hands dirty with the urbit internals, this does seem like a solid project.
