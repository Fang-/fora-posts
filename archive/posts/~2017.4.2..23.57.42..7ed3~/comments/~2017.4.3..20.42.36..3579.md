Worth noting that your first "how not to do this" would work perfectly fine, and is basically what you outlined. Sace the state of each app update after moves, but not the core state machine. Asking for an old revision is just fetching that state and recompiling the Hoon file that gives you the core, which you already do in your outline since you only go into depth attaching marks to state.
