So after an interesting journey to get my talk messages exported from the previous era ~palfun-foslup, I finally had a couple of JSON files containing all my chat history from the last ten months. I figured, hey, who not pull some fun statistics out of this!  
If there's anything you'd like to know, I still got the database here, so just let me know!

I analyzed all of **105.957 messages** from **1238 unique authors** sent to urbit-meta from 2016.08.1..00.14.47's:  
`~worbep_silsev: hello?`  
to 2017.06.14..21.54.31's:  
`~rosfet_loppeg: into the fire!`  
That's about 350 messages a day. Not bad at all! There were some highs and lows there, with only 12 messages on 2016.12.29, and a peak of 1.717 on 2017.02.21.

Graphing all that activity out and adding in a 1-week moving average, we can see Urbit has steadily grown, or at least gotten a lot more active:

Looking at the authors of all that activity, the top 10 of the most active posters looks like this: (I tried my best to account for people who operated multiple ships for longer times!)

```
12.405 ~palfun-foslup
 7.490 ~barpub-tarber
 7.105 ~tonret-sigsur
 6.189 ~master-morzod
 6.029 ~sorreg-namtyv
 5.683 ~ravmel-ropdyl
 4.425 ~pittyp-datfyn
 3.408 ~mastyr-harlud
 2.297 ~ravzod_tinsev
 2.253 ~rolsut-rospub
       ...
```

It shouldn't be surprising to see that about 97% of those messages were regular text messages. And judging by the ratio of smiley- to frowny-faces we're sending, we're a pretty happy community!

```
:) etc. 2.326
:( etc.   409
```

Half of the remainder, 2681 messages, are URLs. Where are they all pointing to?

```
444 github.com
389 urbit.org
184 pastebin.com
 99 youtube.com
 47 imgur.com
 46 wikipedia.org
 35 twitter.com
 24 github.io
 22 ycombinator.com
 21 google.com
    ...
```

Not very surprising to see GitHub and Urbit scoring as well as they do. Consider the most shared URLs:

Moon bugginess is quite famous, isn't it?

Zooming back out, I want to leave you all with this word cloud and our unofficial slogan:
