## `~pittyp-datfyn`
Prior art:
- my "all the marks should compile" [backend](https://github.com/ohAitch/arvo/blob/f602294/app/mark-dashboard.hoon) and [front](https://github.com/ohAitch/arvo/blob/f602294/web/mark-dashboard/main.js) [end](https://github.com/ohAitch/arvo/blob/f602294/web/mark-dashboard.hoon) which can be a starting point for the "app calling ford" approach
- an [unmerged jael test sequence](https://github.com/ohAitch/arvo/blob/21db0da/lib/test/jael.hoon) which `//` "#include"s the tested core directly
- a [collection of `urb.py` scripts](https://github.com/urbit/fleet) meant for external/integration testing
- an earlier framework by `~wictuc-folrex` which I'll try to track down.
