I was under the impression that there wasn't a scry namespace for %ford. I was also under the impression that generators couldn't send cards; the reason that +tree works is because it can call a scry (`.^(arch cy+pax)`) and block for the results, and that I'd need something like an `%fm` scry to get the compiled cores.

> The problem I see is that you can't write tests for your actual app code, only libraries. If Gall had a scry that gave the entire app state, core and all, you could use that though - functional purity is a helluva thing, so you can run arms from the "live" version just fine. Probably replacing the state with a blank, though, for determinisricality.

You'd definitely want to start with a blank slate each test if you went this route. This seems like it would require the app to be `|start`-ed. While ugly, couldn't I just `/%` for the app path?
