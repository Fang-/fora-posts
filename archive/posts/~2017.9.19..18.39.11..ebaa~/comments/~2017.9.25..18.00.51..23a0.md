~dabwel-marsod and ~taglux-nidsep, your concerns are both correct. Hash outputs are not 100% unique and collisions theoretically possible. I glossed over this because collisions are so unlikely in this context that opening the can of worms didn't seem worth it for a normie-centric explanation.

PS. would love a way to get desktop notifications when I'm mentioned in the Urbit universe so I can timely respond to stuff like this.
