I don't think you are confused. 
 I tried to post before about the apparent glossing over of hash collisions in: "but one that is unique and different from any other hash." but fora was playing up for me that day. There are indeed usually multiple inputs that can produce the same hash. But a good hash function scatters these colliding inputs all over the possible input range in a way that collisions are nigh on impossibly difficult to manufacture.
