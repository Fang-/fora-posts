We're hosting a little get together at our new offices next week:

[meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/245925902/](https://www.meetup.com/urbit-sf/events/245925902/)

No talks, no demos, just quality time to hang out.  Come have a beer and figure out where Ajit Pai got [that cup](https://i.imgur.com/1py7aLI.png).

(If you'd prefer not to use meetup.com, you can always RSVP via email to `urbit@urbit.org`)
