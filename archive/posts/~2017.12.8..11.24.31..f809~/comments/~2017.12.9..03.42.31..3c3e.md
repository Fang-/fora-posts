I'm not sure I understand what you're getting at.  I'm certainly no expert, but it's tough to see how Urbit helps the NSA engage in surveillance.  Everything in your Urbit is encrypted.  Also there are no massive central repositories of data as on the current web; e.g., what Facebook and Google have.  *They* might cut a deal with the NSA to share the data of millions, but that simply won't be an option with Urbit.  This is one of the advantages of decentralization.

Urbit runs on some form of Unix, so there are probably vulnerabilities there that the NSA can exploit, but that's no difference from what we have today.

Anyone with a more robust tech background want to follow up?
