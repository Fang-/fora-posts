Nice post. I'll add that we match which formulas to *try* to jet by the battery of the core. How can we use a complicated noun like the battery of a core to do this? Well, all u3_nouns (besides direct atoms, of course) are hashed (lazily, when it's convenient or necessary) with a 31-bit nonzero hash (currently FNV, soon to be a truncated Murmur3-x86-32), so arbitrary nouns can be keys in a hash table.
