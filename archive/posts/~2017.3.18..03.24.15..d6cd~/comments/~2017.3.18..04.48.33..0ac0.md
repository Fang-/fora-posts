I'm partial to the name "solar" for urbitwitter. Follows the space themeing, and you can name timelines solar systems or something. I thought about urbitwitter by myself a few times (and have thought about writing it myself for the past, uh, ever...), sketching out how it would look, and it definitely maps nicely to :talk. Cept for stuff like retweets and hashtags and searches...

Is your current code on GitHub anywhere?

I wrote an image pastebin/voting site a forever ago, and know just what you mean by urbit not being very good at serving images right now. The urbit.org proxy and %ames both choked very hard on sending over large blobs :/ I ended up just going "screw that", deciding that if users want images they should just upload to IPFS or something and only give a link a la Reddit.
