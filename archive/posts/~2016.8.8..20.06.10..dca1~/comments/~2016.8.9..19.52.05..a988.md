## `~raplys-lornex`
Furthermore, the macro we'd need as a cousin to `;~` to implement do-notation Haskell style would be something like:

```
;>  logo
  a  (gulf 1 20)
  b  (gulf 1 20)
  c  (gulf 1 20)
  ~  (guard =((add (mul a a) (mul b b)) (mul c c)))
  (sole [a=a b=b c=c])
```

where ~ indicates some hygenic macro expansion for an unused face, and otherwise it expands into the above example.
