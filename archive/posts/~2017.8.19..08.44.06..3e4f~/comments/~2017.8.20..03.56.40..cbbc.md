`~tashex`, did you change your directory to your `%test` desk? You can do that with:

```
> =dir /=test=
```

That's equivalent to `cd` in a Unix shell. Your `:dojo` keeps its current directory as your `%home` desk by default, so it'd make sense if you were `+ls`-ing and not seeing changes since you synced the `urbit.org`'s ship to your comet's `%test` desk.

It might also help to mount your test desk and diff the files manually on Unix with the files you're trying to sync. You can do that with:

```
> |mount /=test=
```

where a `test` directory will get created inside your comet pier (where you ran your ship from on Unix).
