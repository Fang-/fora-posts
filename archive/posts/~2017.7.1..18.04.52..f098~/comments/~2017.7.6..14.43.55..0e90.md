That sounds like it would be great. The method I outlined in in the linked issue comments would provide members under a core, which would give us the ability to be generic over a collection interface, but honestly that is so unused that it's probably overkill since storing cores gives stale kernels post-update. I kinda forgot that `=,` was a thing...

Sorry for dropping #391! I've hardly been on the computer recently. I do remember that when I was trying it there were some cases it got very messy for, so I'll check if your algorithm handles them correctly. You're my hero.
