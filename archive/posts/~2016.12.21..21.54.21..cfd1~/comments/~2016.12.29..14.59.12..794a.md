## `~palfun-foslup`
I tried my hand at a better `;~` explanation, and thought I could just say "it calls the q functions with the p function in between" (ie `(;~(a b c) x)` is sorta like `(b (a (c x)))`, or c a b because it does things in reverse?) but apparently there's some conditions to that, if that's even fully true to begin with. I can't easily deduce what those are.

The examples in the docs do `<something>`, which is not immediately clear. (It turns the product from `something` into a tape??)

Attempted making a simple example for myself, but it %fire-core errorred, and who knows what that may mean. It'd be ideal if you could clearly and easily see what things happened in which order, like my attempted example would add different multiples of 10 in every gate.

I also observe that the discussion section for `;~`'s docs tells you nothing you need to know. It's kind of counter-informative even, if you know nothing about Kleisli arrows or monads. Tried looking those up, but among the first few hits were none that explained anything to the "layman".
