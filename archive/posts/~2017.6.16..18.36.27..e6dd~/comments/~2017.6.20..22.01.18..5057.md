Thanks ~poldec!

A `wire` is a `path`, aka `(list knot)` (aka `(list @ta)`). Consider the following:

`/thing/~poldec/42`

We *see* a symbol, a ship and a number, but in reality they're all plain `knot`s. To get their *actual values* out, we'll have to do some work. `~.thing` (`@ta`) can be safely cast to `%thing` (`@tas`), but the other two need to be parsed, which looks something like this: `(slav %p i.t.wir)`

A list of coins would have the above path look something like this:

```
[%$ p=[p=~.tas q=%thing]]
[%$ p=[p=~.p q=~poldec]]
[%$ p=[p=~.ud q=42]]
~
```

The wire has been *pre-parsed*, we immediately have all the data to see that the second part of our wire is a ship name with value `~poldec`, etc. No assembly required!

Still, I've experienced coins to be a pain in the ass to work with. Fitting the parsing result into a custom `++query` structure makes it way easier to work with, so I can imagine this becoming a pattern. And if it becomes a pattern, we might as well have Gall do some of the lifting for it.
