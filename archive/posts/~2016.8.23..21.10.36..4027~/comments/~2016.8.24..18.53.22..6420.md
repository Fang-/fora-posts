Curtis, if you're reading this (or anyone else knowledgable), it'd be cool if you could provide a general overview of the work that needs to be done to get functionality around these lines off the ground, so I can see if it's way out of my depth or possibly worth a shot. That is, if you want a scrub dealing with larger scale changes/additions like these. (;
