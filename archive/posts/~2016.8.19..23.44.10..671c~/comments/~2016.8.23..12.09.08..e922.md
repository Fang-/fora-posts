That "rough transition" model may be just what's needed for backup/restore.  I hope the "losing one's mind" event would not leave a permanent scarlet letter in the system.  That would only accumulate across the network as nodes are over time restarted from backups.

By the way, would the urbit event semantics make it possible to use these as the basis of concurrency, in the sense of having live replicate-ships instead of just replicated event logs?
