I'm super interested in this. It's pretty tough to propose moving one's entire personal life into a server they run, then saying that there's no way to perform a backup/restore. It makes it hard to run your planet locally because home servers aren't usually redundant. It makes it hard to run a planet in a cloud because cloud systems regularly take nodes offline. The user must put all of their trust in the provider they go with.

A couple months ago, ~tasfyn-partyv mentioned on Reddit that there's plans to move the log to Kafka. This may be a missing piece in the puzzle. If there's any problems, the system could restore a backup and replay all missing events. Assuming urbit can replay like that anyway. And Kafka is built to cluster, so an urbit doesn't have to be its own cluster.

I'm new to the scene though, so I only know about 2% of the relevant tech here.
