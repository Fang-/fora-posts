You'll never guess who.

Urbit-meta just doesn't cut it for some things. If you want to talk smack about other people's favorite music, video games, or cartoons, come join in on the fun.

- `~paldev/music` for sharing and discussing music,
- `~paldev/games` for discussing video games and arranging play sessions,
- `~paldev/weebs` for talking about animus, mangoes, and related culture.

You won't be banned for having bad taste or bringing the banter. You *will* be banned for bringing bad vibes.
