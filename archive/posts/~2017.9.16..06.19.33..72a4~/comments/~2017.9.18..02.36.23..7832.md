I've certainly thought about adding this kind of rich interrogation to %clay (which lest we forget isn't just a filesystem but a revision-control system).  

I think my main hesitation on something like this is that, as I'm sure Be did, you want to be building at least one, and preferably more, application users of a system like this as you construct the system itself.  Otherwise you're building an API that has no current customers, which is an architecturally underconstrained experience -- it's just too slack.
