For the record, re: "If you are developing an app, you're probably copying these files every time you make a change (because hosting a git repo in urbit is insanity!)." I've been writing Hoon in a git repo, with symlinks from git to Urbit. It seems to work fine.

Having a comprehensive package manager to handle library dependencies would be super sweet :D Right now it's basically just copy-pasting to lib/ through word of mouth, if it happens at all.
