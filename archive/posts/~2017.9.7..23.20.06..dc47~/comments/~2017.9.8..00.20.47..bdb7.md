I think installing a package per desk make sense (it's how i do it) and the tool enables (but doesn't enforce) it.
I didn't think about pulling the dependencies into parent desks, interesting idea. This also gets complicated when introducing versions and what if different apps require different versions (so you need a desk per app and major-version).

Continuously syncing from github is on the roadmap ;-)

I get what you are saying about overwriting files and manifests. Indeed the tool was written to solve an immediate and present problem I encounter while writing apps for urbit. I would love to see advanced capabilities in %clay.

I also forgot to mention that adding a web interface on top of this will allow installing apps for your urbit without needing to mess around with dojo, which may be appealing for some (I personally love CLIs, but I might be in the minority).
