The current testnet has been up without issue for the past nine months.  We’re really excited about that, but the network is beginning to reveal some design bugs.  Due to some early mistakes, the network is actually slowly DDOSing itself to death.  Anyone who has tried to start an urbit will notice this immediately, since it can take hours.  
 
We’re going to do two things to the testnet.  One, we’re going to reboot it this week (by Wednesday) on the existing codebase, and run this reasonably well-tested code for a few weeks.  This will give everyone a chance to play with an Urbit that we know works.
 
Then, we’ll reboot it again with the development interpreter. It could be a bit rocky, but we think it’s well worth it.  Getting our development code out onto the network will help enormously in testing our next release into existence.  (You can think of this release as a kind of `pre-cc-release`) What else is a testnet for but finding bugs?

Happy to answer questions if anyone has them.  We'll tweet and post a new thread when we're ready to breach.
