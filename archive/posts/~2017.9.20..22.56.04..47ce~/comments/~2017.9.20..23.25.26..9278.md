I don't really know all that much about Ethereum, but this all seems to make sense (other than how planet sales work, which I didn't get). Double checking, but this essentially solves the problem of having to give the private key of a ship to the server running it by allowing key rotations signed by a master key via Ethereum, right? That's one of the big things I was hoping to be solved before "launch", and is definitely a great move.
