Woo! I don't know that much about Ethereum, but this looks great. Key rotation via a master key signed message over Ethereum nicely solves one of the problems I hoped would be fixed before "launch". I'm not that sure about how planets get launched though - does each star owner have to run their own contract that is a copy of Tlons galaxy constract, but for their star instead?

Also, how are existing stars spark tokens going to be given out. Redeemable via the website if you enter a valid star ticket?
