> I strongly encourage Urbit cut the umbilical from Ethereum as soon as viable

^-- Not invented here syndrome. Great way to doom Urbit.

Stick with Ethereum, they're the world's leading experts (along with the Bitcoin devs) on this problem, and they are making way better progress on it than anyone, including Urbit, can do.

Or, you can ignore me, and just design your own programming language, operating system, blockchain consensus algorithms, sharding algorithms, computer, all by yourselves.
