## `~bidpem-davbes`
Formerly, ~rabtug-molhut, now ~bidpem-davbes and ~dollug-rannyt. I managed to nuke ~dollug-rannyt while experimenting with Docker/Windows, so it's dead until the next breach. Obviously there was a second ship before as well, but I don't remember off the top of my head. According to email, it was ~nidsyp-laplep.
