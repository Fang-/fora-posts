Ah, I probably had it confused with how `++sigh` arms work. Thanks!

I just committed most all of my current changes, you can see the commit [here](https://github.com/Fang-/arvo/commit/7b997930e06972a136674011d5785eb25add01a6). Still requires lots of cleanup, but this should give you a complete picture to look at.

If you can shed more light on how exactly I'm not processing console edits, that'd be really great. Thanks for your help so far!
