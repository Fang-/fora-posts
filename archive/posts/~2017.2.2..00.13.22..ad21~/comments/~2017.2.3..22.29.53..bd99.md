## `~palfun-foslup`
Progress!

Currently trying to get in-talk `;commands` to work. For example, `;poll ~ship id` to request results for the poll with that id.

`++sh-work` contains a core which uses `++work` to choose a sister arm to call based on the `;command` that was entered. In my case, `++poll` gets called. To remain compatible with `++work`, its result has to fit the same mold as `..sh-work` does.

If my understanding is correct and the compiler isn't just being super lenient all of a sudden, `..sh-work` in that context refers to the `sh` core. Using that knowledge, I can make the calls to `++ra-poll` and `++ra-emit` I need to either post our own poll, or ask another ship to post its poll.  
Code for the `++poll` work arm can be seen [here](http://pastebin.com/HJ81Fc2w).

It compiles, but when I enter a `;poll` command into talk, it prints the debug `%poking-poll` and then freezes. Pressing a key unlinks talk and shows a stack-trace for a `%drum-coup-fial` that points to talk's `++poke-sole-action`.

No idea where that comes from, I'm not (purposefully) doing and sole-actions (the `sh-note`s don't get hit, seeing the `%poking-poll` prints). Anyone have an idea?
