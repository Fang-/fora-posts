Until recently, each pill (the binary blob your Urbit downloads as part of its boot sequence) was at the location `https://bootstrap.urbit.org/<git_hash>-maint.pill`. This has now been changed to `https://bootstrap.urbit.org/<git_hash>-<git_branch>.pill`. This is relevant for anyone who is writing Urbit code, when you need to spawn a fakezod for development. If you're just running Urbit and not developing on it, this shouldn't affect you. The details of the present dev workflow (for the maintenance branches) can be found [here](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/blob/maint-0.4/CONTRIBUTING.md).

In the (currently unreleased) master branch, there is also a new feature to ease the development workflow. In the master branch, if you don't supply a `-B /path/to/pill.pill` argument when starting a fakezod, and instead provide `-s`, Urbit will look in the .git directory of the arvo folder specified in `-A /path/to/arvo/folder`, and download a pill for you based on the git branch and hash of that folder. You can still do `-B` to override that behavior.

Example:
`bin/urbit -sFI zod -A ../arvo -c zod`

There is currently a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/issues/895) for poor error reporting from this feature, as well as an open [pull request](https://github.com/urbit/urbit/pull/898) from ~master-morzod to improve the error reporting.

As the person who made these changes, I apologize for the frustration that not communicating about this properly has caused people here. Please feel free to ask questions about this in the comments to this post, and we'll update the official docs to reflect the new scheme when we do the breach.
