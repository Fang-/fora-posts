Neat!  The egz.hope code is a pretty casual, prototype-grade attempt at an ACID database.  I wouldn't be surprised if it was susceptible to any number of clever bandaids.

We have a replacement for this and the rest of the event management  (urbit/urbit master branch), but it hasn't made it into the upcoming breach because it's tied to the next-generation kernel.  It's always a hard choice between applying bandaids and rewriting it right -- and we don't always make that choice correctly :-/

I'll try to spend a bunch of December on various bandaids, hopefully most of them in code that will last more than a few months or two.  The priority is performance, but consistency also needs work -- I think you've seen that in filesystem sync as well...
