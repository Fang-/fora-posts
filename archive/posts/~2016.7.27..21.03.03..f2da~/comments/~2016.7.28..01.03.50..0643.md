## `~raplys-lornex`
Yes. `~doznec-sampel-sipnym` is `0x1.abcd.1234` (assuming `~sampel-sipnym` is `0xabcd.1234`).

With no scrambling involved, `0x1.0000` is `~doznec-dozzod`. This has no leading zeroes; `doznec` is 1, not 0. A *word* is a "digit", not a syllable. The irregularity is solely in the single-word space, because we call galaxies by half-word names - `~zod` rather than `~dozzod`. Hence, a leading `doz` there is illegal because the mapping should be one-to-one. Otherwise, galaxies would have two names, one "galaxylike" and one "starlike". This is actually a bug that exists in the current system - try typing `~marzod` into dojo.
