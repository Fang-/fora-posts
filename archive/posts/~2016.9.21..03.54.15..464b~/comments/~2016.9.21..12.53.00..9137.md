Urbit uses persistant state, an append-only log of your entire life and a current state. If you end up corrupting the state (egz.hope) then you can replay your entire life with urbit -D, but if your log is corrupted/loses events then your ship is usually sunk, and you're stuck unless someone at Tlon can brain surgery you back to life.

I'm pretty sure that .urb/code.~hash is a passcode that is used to encrypt your state and log and doesn't change, so the fact that it was corrupted (along with both of the other two) probably means some bad filesystem/memory corruption happened.
