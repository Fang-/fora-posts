- egz.hope shouldn't be corrupted by unexpected termination. Unfortunately, there are still some cases where this does happen. To prevent unexpected termination from losing network connection, run urbit in screen or tmux.
- You can't back up urbits in any useful way, so restoring from a backup effectively destroyed your planet even if it was recoverable. It would be replayable from just the event log if you deleted the checkpoint, but it would be unusable on the Urbit network.
- If you're worried about data integrity, the correct way to go is something like a RAID. Old states of your event log are generally not valid due to the Urbit protocol's exactly-once message delivery.
