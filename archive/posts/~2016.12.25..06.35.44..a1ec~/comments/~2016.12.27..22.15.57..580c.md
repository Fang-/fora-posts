This is really great.  

The first thing it reminds me of is that I wish we had the equivalent of 'fork' and 'pull request'.  Even our 'official' docs are in `%clay`.  So are these, obviously, and in order for people to really collaborate on these things it needs to be really easy for people to trade changes.
