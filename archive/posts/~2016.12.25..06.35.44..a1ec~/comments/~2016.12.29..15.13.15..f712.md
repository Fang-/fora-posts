>I remain resolutely convinced that Hoon is a very simple language :-/

Yes it is. I had written three whole paragraphs on why *being* simple doesn't equal ease of understanding and use, but it all sort of boils down to: Hoon and its concepts are foreign, which inspires fear and misunderstanding. Concepts being "sort of like this thing you know, except this and that" may be a bigger hurdle than concepts being unlike anything you've seen before.
