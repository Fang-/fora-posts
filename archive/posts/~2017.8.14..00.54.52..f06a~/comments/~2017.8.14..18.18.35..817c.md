## `~rophex-hashes`
Exactly. You probably want to run your urbit on encrypted storage.
I think in that case you can keep your state unencrypted in urbit.
The same cannot be said for secrets stored in files since urbit doesn't have access control implemented yet, IIUC (so they can be pulled by any urbit).
