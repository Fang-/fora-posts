I had posted my comment on YouTube but then realized it's best suited here. Maybe you can provide a link in the video description to this fora post.

Awesome work ~taglux! This  is clearly the best (only?) gentle introduction to Hoon video in existence. I really enjoyed the visual setup (as ~palfun mentioned in :talk this morning) with the head on the top left, editor on the right, and :dojo all the way across the bottom; mind sharing which recording/video applications and camera you use? I use an Ubuntu GNOME desktop.

Do you want to slap some links in the description so folks know where they can sink their teeth even deeper? Maybe www.urbit.org/docs/hoon and perhaps the Urbit homepage as well would be helpful. 

Again, great job. Looking forward to learn what you have planned for a full-fledged Hoon series.
