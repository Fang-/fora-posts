Very sorry, hit the post button by accident while still composing my thoughts. 

This is ~divmec-panfex, and I got a crash of some sort. subsequent attempts to start the planet got a bail: oops error. 

I fired up my comet and it did the same thing as my planet.

Then I started a new comet, and it said this:

```
ubuntu@my-server:~$ urbit -c newera02
~
urbit 0.5.1
urbit: home is newera02
loom: mapped 2048MB
newera02/.urb/chk/north.bin: No such file or directory
boot: image failed
```

it's missing a binary file? What's going on?
