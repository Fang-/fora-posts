Hi Palfun, this is ~divmec-panfex again. It's running from an Ubuntu instance on a free-tier AWS box - after adding swap, of course. This is the same instance that has worked perfectly for over a year. Yes, I built from the latest source - at least I tried and I think I succeeded (0.5.1 number seems to bear that out).
