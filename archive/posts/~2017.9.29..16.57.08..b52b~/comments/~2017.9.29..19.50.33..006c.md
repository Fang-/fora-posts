I think the names have defaults, and editing them causes a new .plan to be recreated; if you had any API usernames in the .plan you might need to put them back in manually.

It definitely should be possible to edit `css` from unix; is the error that it's failing to register changes completely? If so, does it help to restart the pier with `^D urbit foo/`, or `|unmount` `|mount` the relevant directory?
