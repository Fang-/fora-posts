## `~rophex-hashes`
I had to restart the container (my mistake). After starting a new comet the memory usage is much lower (188MB, urbit is using about 90MB) :

```
             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          594M       419M       174M       592K        66M       164M
-/+ buffers/cache:       188M       405M
Swap:           0B         0B         0B
```
