This was a fun and great walkthrough, thanks ~tonlur + Jordan <:o)

Great resource for ppl like me who understand some of the higher-level organization of Urbit, but lack chops navigating the nitty-gritty of our console experiences thus far.

Only criticism is the length of this video, even as a big fan of this place and y'alls work, it was hard to sit through 2 hours of video, even with breaks every so often.

It might be interesting to format these videos as a playlist, with ~5-10 min videos broken out to explain disparate parts of the overall Urbit ecosystem + structure.

Other than this (tiny) critique, the tone and 'voice' of the video was friendly and engaging, and concepts were explained in a simple manner. Throughout the videos, the chain of uniquely named concepts definitely required one to pay close attention, so it might be cool to insert visual graphics/models when 'dependency concepts' are brought up to explain other Urbit-y concepts.
