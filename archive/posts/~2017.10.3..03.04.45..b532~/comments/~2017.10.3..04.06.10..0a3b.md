To continue, if we are to adopt the holistic approach to the docs, hyperlinking within this so-called semantic web (semantic web not quite the best phrase, I'm afraid-- maybe "concentridocs" is better? lol) is of tantamount importance. As I was saying earlier in `:talk`: Hoon itself is so semantically pregnant (with twins, probably), ink is easily spilled (as we continue to see). When exploring the docs, almost everything should be clickable: perhaps a "peek" and a "jump" are good verbs to partition the navigation to short vs. long form documentation.
