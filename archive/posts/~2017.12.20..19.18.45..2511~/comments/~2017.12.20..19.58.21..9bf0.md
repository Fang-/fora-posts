Dear ~hidmun*samzod,

Your analogy with MMORPG reputation systems, though uncanny, does not apply to Urbit.

Even though more money can give you access to shorter addresses, if you attempt to use these addresses for nefarious reasons, your reputation will invariably go down the drain, regardless of the amount of money you put in. This is in stark contrast to MMORPG, when more money allows you to beat players despite relatively short game time and thus gain unfair advantage.

Furthermore, "authorities acquiring identities" is not any different from "authorities acquiring bitcoins" or "authorities acquiring anything". Your Urbit identity can be definitely made well protected, even to the point when it is infeasible to steal save threats of physical violence to the owner. 

The subsequent parts are unclear in meaning to me, hence I refrain from further comments.
