I have roughly the same problem with planet ~tondun-davryp.

For me if i try to visit https://tondun-davryp.urbit.org/ my browser spends about 2 minutes thinking then gives me a 504 error. This has been the cause for several days.

~taglux-nidsep mentions that he had a blog I added several .md files for testing in my mounted folder so I'm not sure if thats related. I also moved my planet from one server to another server roughly around that time period.
