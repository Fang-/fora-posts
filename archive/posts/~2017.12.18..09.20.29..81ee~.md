To see very alpha plato version head to: https://github.com/mikolajpp/plato

What works:
typing in the editor in Nock mode.

What does not work:
everything else.

Right now I am implementing Urb.js functionality in Elm. 
By the end of this week it should be possible to at least compile Nock. 

I know a lot of you are waiting for better way to write tick-tack-toe in pure Nock. It is coming! ;-)
