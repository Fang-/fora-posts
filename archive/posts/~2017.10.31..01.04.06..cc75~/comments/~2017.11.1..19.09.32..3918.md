> Sole is pretty much only append-only right now, instead of something like returning the entire UI each update and diffing.

Which is painfully slow. (I actually tried.)

Last I heard sole was going to get some updates, but no text-matrix console printing or whatever. Which is weird, considering that saying "sole will be append-only lists forever" is relegating the cli to the role of "just doing some stuff in dojo and very simple apps" forever.

I get that we have a fancy new "universal console" concept planned, but some people/applications will still prefer working from a more traditional cli. Are we going to say "no" to that forever?

It'd be cool to see a UP for "better sole". I imagine this'll involve a nice amount of work on both the vere and arvo sides, but I'm not too familiar with this particular area.
