There's also at least one UP around key management. 

- We *at least* need a thorough document that covers best practices. How to handle your Urbit keys is something we should do our absolute best to communicate clearly about. 
- The exact mechanics of how your Urbit key and your ETH key operate is interesting. I should be able to do an on-chain key update that effectively revokes my Urbit key, for example.
- Key recovery is also something I'm asked about a lot. The [uPort](https://whitepaper.uport.me/uPort_whitepaper_DRAFT20170221.pdf) 'recovery delegates' model is interesting in this regard.

I'd leave it to people smarter than me to fill in the specifics. Just a few ideas.
