## `~master-morzod`
There's an error I failed to catch in your summary at the end. In my example, the adapter is first called with the product of `(crip "bbc")` and the next gate (`++dec` wrapped in another call to the adapter). There are four gates in the pipeline, and the adapter is called three times, once between each pair of gates.

Thanks for saving this!
