~sigmes : there is no problem as long as you shut your ship down first. you could shut it down and then bring it up on a different host a month later and it would just "catch up".

the problem is "taking a backup" and then running the ship for a while and then turning it off and trying to go back to the backup. the running ship has already acknowledged a series of messages that the other one has not but that the network thinks it has, so its out-of-sync and can't catch up because its alter ego has already consumed those messages. urbit messages are delivered exacty once. 

Make sense?
