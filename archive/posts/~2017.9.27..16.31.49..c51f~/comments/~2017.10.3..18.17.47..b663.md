I'm the original author of that comment introducing sloe, and I'm...not entirely sure what I was thinking. Sorry about that. `arvo` is actually the type of the cards that the kernel emits, not the kernel core itself. I probably meant `vent`, or that the un-named core that implements arvo itself was just named "++  arvo" (it isn't). But this brings up the interesting question of "why does that even work, and why does it output `[%$]`?"

The problem is that, in Hoon, all types are also /functions/. This lets us have some neat properties, but also causes problems like you discovered: what you're asking is "what arms are in /the type itself/ arvo", which isn't the same thing as a value of type arvo. And because all functions (gates) in Hoon are just cores with an arm named `$`, it lists that arm. You would actually need `(sloe -:!>(*arvo)))` - that is, "what arms are in a blank instance of type arvo". And this will give `~` (an empty list), because `*arvo` isn't a core.
