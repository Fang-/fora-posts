I also emacs, so that that seems fine. I don't know what you mean by jaque? can you clarify? ~sorreg seems to be indicating that having the urbit would not be well served by the long-lived Unix socket required for such a subscription.  As I have been writing more hoon I am coming to realize hoon is fairly "big bang" styled (in that the whole hoon file tends to be a single expression and the subexpression need the context of the wrapping expression to make any kind of sense) and would not lend it's self well to being partially evaluated like you would want to do with an editor repl integration. So we may need to find a different path... Thinking about autocompletion using the python client doesn't sound too bad...  It might be a better idea to make dojo a more full-fledged develop environment? maybe turn it into more of a text editor? My current pain with hoon development is mostly that I have to wait until I poke my app to get any feedback about whether it's working and that requires switching context to my %dojo.
