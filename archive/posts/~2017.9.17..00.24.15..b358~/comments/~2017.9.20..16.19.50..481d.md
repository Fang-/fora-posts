I think sending pokes from an emacs (or nvim maybe?) console and subscribing (in some way that isn't currently vere-supported, but could be - this would be pretty easy in jaque, actually, as effects are already distributed using clojure.core.async's pubsub interface) to the %term effects is an interesting idea. dojo is a pretty good repl, and it'd be on a whole other wire so it shouldn't interfere with anything, should it? i'm not super familiar with dojo's internals, but i assume it has entirely seperate sessions because things like the web console exist.
