I was joking with someone the other day that I managed to shave the Urbit elevator pitch down to about 30 minutes.  The parody pitch has the template "[New product] is like [familiar product] only for [something different]".  Like "Kittenstar3000 is like Uber only for cats".

For Urbit, the best I've been able to come up with is something like: "Okay watch this video.  I'll wait..."

"You back?  Okay, Urbit is like WeChat, only you actually control your data."

At this point I'm usually tempted to keep talking, since I really feel like this only scratches the surface.  Besides, I think the ultimate form this thing takes is completely unknowable.  Unfortunately "emergent order" doesn't make for a compelling pitch either*.

Long-winded way of asking, does anyone have a good answer when people ask, "What's this Urbit thing?"  Ideally less than 30 minutes, without any props, videos, or drawings on whiteboards.

* Actually, it's compelling for me, but then I'm atypical about these things.
