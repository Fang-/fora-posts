~lapdur This is also great feedback -- thanks! We're aware of how bad of a UI this is too; it's been this way for so long because of technical limitations. But providing a docs UI in this kind of style is in our near-term future with our web-publishing redesigns. Additionally it'd be great if all of the doc titles were viewable in a side panel like most sites have (see Ethereum, Docker, React, Stripe, Fish shell, etc.'s docs).
