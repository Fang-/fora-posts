So like, if we're not designing for a broken urbit, there absolutely is a useful workflow: you have an urbit on an unreliable local client, which is rafted etc. to the cloud; your local client can die mid-keystroke and this should not result in losing hours of work.

Not saving every keystroke is ~lame~, and done due to a mixture of system performance(which we can fix) and namespacing those less useful edits(which the `%home-bosdut-sigder` sync model addresses, as would formal commits to a non-`%home` "release" desk).
