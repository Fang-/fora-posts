The mark files in `/mar` are used wherever marks are used, including apps that don't talk to other ships. An app that passes messages to another ship is just a special case of an app with poke/peer/diff/etc. arms that produces lists of moves and the app state. 

But obviously the `&noun` mark has been working in `:dojo` for our simple examples like `%echo` thus far. 

```
> |start %examples-echo
activated app home/examples-echo
'prep'
>=
> :examples-echo '~zod is my neighbor'
[%argument 2.551.987.902.819.530.504.678.012.066.418.894.624.961.559.166]
>=
~zod:dojo> 
```

Somehow we just forgot to explicitly add this simple noun mark, I think, even though technically everything is passed over the wire as a noun through `%ames`. Basically, these mark things should be consistent everywhere they're used, and it's confusing when it's not and we get around stuff with opaque hacks deep in the vanes.

`~pittyp` can give a clearer explanation on this sometime tomorrow.
