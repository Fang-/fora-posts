## `~palfun-foslup`
Added `++find-any` and `++find-last-any` which act as `++find` and `++find-last` for multiple needles. Also `++cram` for cutting lines up into max-width chunks.

Pretty happy to finally have `++wrapper` implemented, a fairly powerful line-wrapping function, including support for custom breakpoints, indentation and tab expansion (both by `n` spaces, or up to every `n`th index like proper tabs would).  
If you just want simple, bare-bones line-wrapping without all the arguments, `++wrap` does line-wrapping with sensible defaults.
