Dude, you missed out on a change to name something "Middle Urb".

I'm not a JavaScripter, let alone a React+Reductionary, so I can't give much in-depth feedback there, but the mapping to your actions seems straightforward enough.

The thought of generating the necessary JS from marks files sounds interesting, but I always feel like the point where you start generating code is the point where you should stop and look if there isn't a better way.

About your Hoon code, a few things immediately catch my eye. There's so many `=/`! If you structured your code slightly differently you could probably dissolve these into other runes.

You also do some funky things with aligning runes and their bodies. Consider the following recommendations (grouped in yours-mine pairs), based on official Hoon style found in the source and the syntax docs.)

```
:~
  first-item
  second-item
==
:~  first-item
    second-item
==
::
%-
  whatever
  some-arg
%-  whatever
some-arg
::
?~  foo
  ~
  bar
?~  foo  ~
bar
```

tl;dr: I guess you're [indenting too much](https://github.com/vvisigoth/taskk/blob/master/app/taskk.hoon#L267-L276). We have backstep for a reason. (;
