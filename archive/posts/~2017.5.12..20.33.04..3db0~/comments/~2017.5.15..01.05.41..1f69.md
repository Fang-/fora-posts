A couple of points on this:

One, it'd be *fantastic* to have someone devoting some effort to `%clay`.  It's actually pretty good code, but its author (a) was 20 years old and (b) literally moved to Patagonia.  I am about to go fix a merge bug in `%clay` on maintenance, so I'll be in there as well.

Two, happy to handhold you as far as we can.  Email me, curtis at tlon dot io.

Three, the issue of collaborative document management is slightly more complex than perhaps Galen let on.  You should not be talking directly (and you can't talk directly) from a browser page to the `%clay` vane.  The way this is supposed to work is that you talk to a server -- a `%gall` app, in new gall it will be a "guardian" (only guardians can receive inbound connections).

Yes, permissions do need to be added to `%clay`, but I would not really characterize this as one of the largest/hardest pieces of work you need to do.  If you are looking for an MS scale project, there are probably more substantial pieces of surgery we can come up with...
