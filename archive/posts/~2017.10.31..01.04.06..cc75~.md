Now that we have [Urbit Proposals](https://urbit.org/~~/fora/posts/~2017.10.19..03.45.26..dbec~/), here are a number of things that we've discussed at Tlon for which we'd love to see some proposals, presented in no particular order:
- interactive folding of spans and cores in web dojo
- web-based code and markdown editor using ace or codemirror
- web-based %clay file navigator
- terminal-based %clay file navigator
- add basic help inside dojo
- add long options like --version and --help to urbit command line tool
- gather profiling metrics and find performance bottlenecks
- improve hoon error messages, rust-style
- have dojo only parse when enter is pressed
- end-to-end error acks for inter-vane and inter-app communication
- integration testing architecture
- unit testing architecture (talk to ~littel-ponnys)
- use rpython in vere
- docs on |autoload for kernel development

If you have questions or ideas about these, please feel free to mention them in a comment here, and I'll do my best to answer.
