Nope! You build a core that has arms that yield either the add or multiplication cores. We have docs that go into building gates, but it doesn't look like we have any that go into full library cores anymore - I think /docs did at one point, and I know the old-old urbit.org [site](https://github.com/urbit/old-urbit.org/blob/master/doc/nock/tut/3.md) did.
