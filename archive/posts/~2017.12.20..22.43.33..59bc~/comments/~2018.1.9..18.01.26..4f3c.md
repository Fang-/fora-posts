I can't weigh in on any deeply technical aspects of the question, but one point:
"good luck getting stars to run your dinky little tech demo."
It seems to me that which dinky tech demos certain stars support will be a significant factor in that star's value(both prestige/trust and planet hosting sale price). 

e.g., Star A sells/hosts planets for $5 and $1.00/month and supports no such services. Star B sells/hosts planets for $20 and $2.50/month and supports any such services which have been nominated by a planet in good standing and have been vetoed by fewer than 25% of the planets in good standing.

It seems such services could organically proliferate through most stars with even a small initial user base.
