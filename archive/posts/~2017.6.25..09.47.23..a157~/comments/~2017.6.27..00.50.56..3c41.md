The way we've been adding graphics so far is web API frontends, whether the one you're looking at right now or mobile apps also querying HTTP; I think in unix you'd want some wrapper process formally exchanging events with an urbit one, though there is definitely any case to be made for "write-only side effect" window drawing as long as all the SDL callbacks come back in through the event loop.
