+1 on documenting ~all the things~

I feel like it is entirely reasonable to declare that doccords are markdown, but leave support to the interface layer: we can generat the docs from it, and syntax plugins can highlight it accordingly, but e.g. the `? ` syntax can display it as is, and it'll be readable because that's the whole point of markdown.

Can confirm that `iny` is a hack, and at least needs a lot of descriptive names thrown at it. I'll take a look at further mini flying the example, it probably is `iny` but then `~/ %in` could as well be `:- ~`, and so on.
