Right now defining types is a bunch of irregular runes, but it isn't actually context-sensitive overloading of existing runes. This is very important, I think, because new users aren't confused that `[a b]` means a fundamentally different thing. The head of `^-` is just a term, not arbitrary Hoon that isn't actually valid Hoon anywhere else. The "(a b c) still means slam, now it just means 'slam with arguments in the same syntax we're already in'" line is an abomination, personally.

I thought it over, and I think I just straight like doccords in the type system better. You can inspect and touch the types at runtime with `!>`, and the compiler correctly propagates and computes the types, and so keeps comments, while its going through the code. This method wouldn't work for anything other than trivial AST scanning: if you have `=/  a/span  p.q.r.s.t` with a non-trivial `t` and wanted to inspect `a` from a debugger or editor hint for autocomplete, that's *harder* than being able to compute `!>(.)` at the breakpoint location and translate axises. This works fine for static docs, but you wouldn't be able to have a `+help foo` generator to inspect at the REPL and would be purely textual, instead of working with the values that you as a programmer use at runtime. This proposal also makes compilation more complex with a post-production step and backtracking parser.
