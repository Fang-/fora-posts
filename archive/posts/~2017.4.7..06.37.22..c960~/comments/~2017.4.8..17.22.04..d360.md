Is there a reason you can't just add a `typ/?` field in span's $core variant? Have `@`, `_p`, `p/q` and `{p q}` all dissolve into a core with typ set, and normal gates into otherwise. Then `!>((pair @ term))` is trivially a mold while `!>(add)` isn't, while keeping the idea that all molds are cores, just type-level subsets.

I spent a while trying to implement this on my own, but the compiler is, uh, opaque and I just hit a bunch of roadblocks on setting up a fakezod. And then I ended up just getting spurious nest-fails in the middle of lines in untouched code, even if my change didn't change anything.

(@goes through the compiler and tries to figure out if this actually makes sense...)
