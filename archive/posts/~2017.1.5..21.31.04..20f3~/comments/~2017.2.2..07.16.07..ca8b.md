It's just the hash of the git commit you're looking to boot from.  So, for example:

- Let's say you've got `arvo/` checked out at `1712865c1525394333ec6bc1d408c80ad5391f5c`.  
- Download the pill from `https://bootstrap.urbit.org/1712865c1525394333ec6bc1d408c80ad5391f5c.pill`
- Then pass that filename to `-B`.  Something like: 
```
bin/urbit -FI zod -A ./arvo -B 1712865c1525394333ec6bc1d408c80ad5391f5c.pill -c zod
```

Does that make sense?
