I am working on a solution of mosh+ITerm. But since I am using LXCs I donâ€™t think tmux would work.
Anyway, so my planet (ship) is lost beyond hope?
I think this is the fourth I am loosing the last couple of days.

Is this common at this stage for urbit or is it bad sysadmin skills from my behalf?
