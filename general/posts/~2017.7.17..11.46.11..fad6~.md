Why does Hoon have several of each mathematical function?  I understand that adding two atoms is a different process from adding two signed ints, or two double precision floats, or whatever....  But that's just as true for C as it is for Hoon, and yet the former can add all of those with the same `+` sign.

Why not have a single ++add function which looks at the span to figure out what kind of arguments are being passed, and then responding accordingly?
