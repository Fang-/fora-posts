There are actually a lot of connectors, but AFAIK they has not been extensively tested, and pretty much are rudimentary: it is not possible to treat them as a gmail replacement, more so that we currently lack GUI for such.

In the feature we will have protocol agnostic messaging applications with integrated connectors to every service out there (apart from urbit native transport), but as of today this vision is not yet realized.
