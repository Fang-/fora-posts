Hey there!

Which command did you use to redeem your planet? If you used the `-c` tag upon creating, then you would have created a comet, which the underscore reflects. You should have had to redeem your planet via a ticket that would have been sent to you by email.

I ask, because that would explain the Talk error. Basically, since a comet's parent is a galaxy (in this case, ~`zod`) and not one of our stars (which host the /urbit-meta channel), as a comet you would have to specify which star whose urbit-meta channel you're trying to join, i.e.:
```
:talk=;join ~marzod/urbit-meta
```
Basically, if you were on your planet, that command would work. But you're on a comet instead.

That make any sense?
