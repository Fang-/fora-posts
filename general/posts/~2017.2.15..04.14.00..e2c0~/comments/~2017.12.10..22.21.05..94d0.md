`~rocbyt` You're also more than welcome to run another `|ask 'your@email.com'` command in your comet's Dojo. We'll send another planet invite to the email address you give us, and you can get up and running during this continuity era under a different planet name. It will probably be several months before we perform another continuity breach (hopefully the last one ever) for our next `cc-release`, and you can get your original planet you deleted back. We know, losing your planet does suck -- hopefully this will help!
