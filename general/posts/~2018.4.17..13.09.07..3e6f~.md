I'm searching for a Urbit video I once saw, but which I can't seem to find again. It was an animation, not an interview or a live presentation or anything like that.

It showed Nock, then pellet-like loading Hoon on top of that, then I remember it mentioned some more things like a simple browser, and a 'vault for secrets', on top of those.

Anyone remember what I'm talking about? I want to show it to a friend, as I thought it was a perfect short video introduction to what Urbit is all about.

Many thanks in advance.
