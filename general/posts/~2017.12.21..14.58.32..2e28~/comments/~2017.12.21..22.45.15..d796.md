Hey ~natmur! Yeah, make sure you build from source as per the install doc, for now. If you run with the correct built binary, your Urbit version on boot should show as `0.5.1`, not `0.4.5`.

If you keep having problems with this, let us know here! Thanks for being patient. We're working on making installing Urbit easier and less potentially confusing.
