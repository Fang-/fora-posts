Yep, `-:!>` (pronounced "hep col zap gar") is called the "type spear." Breaking it down, from right to left:

`!>` (pronounced zap gar) is a rune that produces a `vase`, which is a cell of `[span noun]`, based on compiling the hoon expression inside it. `noun` refers to the compiled nock code, which has a hoon type of `*`, meaning "any noun," and `span` is a hoon data structure representing the type of the compiled expression.

`-:`, pronounced "hep col," takes the head of a pair. `-:foo` means take the head of `foo`. So, taking the head of our vase, we get the `span`, which represents the type of our expression. `++sloe` is a gate (function) that takes a span as its argument, and produces a result containing the list of all the arms (dynamically computed attributes) of a core (hoon's equivalent of an object).

Note that the compiled nock (the code that gets run as a result of compiling hoon) does _not_ contain the type information, which means it does not contain the names of the arms, only their code. This is why you need to run `!>` first, before calling `++sloe`, to compile the expression and also get its span.
