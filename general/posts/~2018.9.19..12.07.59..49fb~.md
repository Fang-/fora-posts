Some of you may have seen that Linux recently adopted a new code of conduct, a process which I played a part in. However, in the words of the late Nelson Mandela: "After climbing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to climb."

As a long time follower of Urbit, I believe it is time for Urbit to adopt a new code of conduct, that is more inclusive and representative of the entire community of developers. I know some of you are already on board with this, since Galen and Curtis both signed the Post-meritocracy Manifesto.

Personally, I believe that the code of conduct adopted by Linux is also suitable for Urbit, but am opening the issue up for discussion.

Thanks,

Coraline.
