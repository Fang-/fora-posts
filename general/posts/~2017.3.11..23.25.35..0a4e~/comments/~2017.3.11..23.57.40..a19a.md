Update... It works! I still get that %ap-abut-bad-bone %talk 18 thing whenever a message is sent over talk. How can I figure out/fix what's causing it? Does the 18 have anything to do with a revision of my home? Should I try updating to a newer urbit (I think the term is vere)?
Again, sorry for what are probably really dumb questions and incorrect terms...
