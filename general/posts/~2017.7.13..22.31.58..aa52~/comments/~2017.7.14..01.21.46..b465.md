Another tip I would recommend, especially if you are hacking on vanes or working with zuse datastructures for an app, is to use `? *foobar` where foobar is the type you are looking at. A lot of the definitions for data structures are hard to follow from the code (heavily nested p/q/r/s, small layered intermediate types) but using the pretty printer will show you the concrete types of the arms of what you are working with in a much easier fashion.
