The 4k spec has been updated very recently -- Nock 12 (edit) is now Nock 10.  The old Nock 10 (hint) is now Nock 11.  (The old "Nock 11", for scrying, wasn't actually part of Nock.  It still isn't, but we hide this non-Nock at Nock 12 now.)

Nock 10, edit, is for editing a noun.

```
*[a 10 [b c] d]     #[b *[a c] *[a d]]
```

To understand this, you need to understand `#`.  `#` (`edit`) is for replacing part of a noun with another noun. `#[x y z]` replaces the value at slot `x` of `z` (i.e., `/[x z]`) with `y`. For some examples: `#[2 11 [22 33]]` is `[11 33]`; `#[3 11 [22 33]]` is `[22 11]`; `#[4 11 [[22 33] 44]]` is `[[11 33] 44]`; and `#[5 11 [[22 33] 44]]` is `[[22 11] 44]`.

Nock 10 is just a way to do this operation on a couple of computed formulas, `c` and `d`.   The `d` part is the noun to be 'edited'.  The `b` part is the address of (the product of) `d` that you want to change.  (The product of) `c` is the noun you want to insert at address `b` of `d`.
