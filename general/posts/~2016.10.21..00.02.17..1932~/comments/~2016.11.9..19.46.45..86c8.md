It's not _just_ a talk channel, the primary store is `%clay` markdown(see url in my second comment). 

Re: n reductions, unfortunately this is infeasible to do transparently in the face of jets; presumably you could explicitly call out to vere via an event, but the ford control flow would get onerous. Really, the forum-post event should recompute the frontend artifacts, so if that crashes you can just reject the file / "Add comment" json request; this still doesn't deal with /finite/ loops that are calibrated to bring the system just under the event timeout, though. (The eventual social solution is "subs can't post", or not with exec privileges at any rate)
