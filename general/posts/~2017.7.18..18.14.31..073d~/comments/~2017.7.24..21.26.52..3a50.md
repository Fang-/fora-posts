You don't have to run nginx (or comparable) as a reverse proxy, you can just forward your port 80 like so (this is for a plain vanilla Amazon Linux AMI):

sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to-destination :8080

I am running my planet this way using a sub-domain of my custom domain: http://urbit.ngzax.com/. It seems much more responsive than http://hosneb-rosler.urbit.org/
