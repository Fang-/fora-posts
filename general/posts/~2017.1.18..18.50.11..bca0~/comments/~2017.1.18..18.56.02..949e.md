Connecting to arbitrary talk channels from within an Urbit app is covered [here](https://github.com/Fang-/Urbit-By-Doing/blob/master/talkbot/3.md). Further details on how to work with the data that'll get you is covered in part four which... still isn't finished yet.  
It should be enough to get you off the ground for that part of your application!

I'm personally not sure about sending data out of your Urbit to unix. You can do http requests easily, but I wouldn't be able to tell you about interfacing with unix from within Urbit.
