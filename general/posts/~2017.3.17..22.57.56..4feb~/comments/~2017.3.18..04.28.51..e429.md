Thank you! Contributing has been a great experience on its own merits -- but this
is an incredible bonus!

Congrats, `~ponnys` and `~palfun`, and thanks to all of you for your patient
answers and explanations here, in `urbit-meta`, and on github. I've learned a
ton from our conversations (and just lurking).

Now, to see if I can rewrite %clay in the next six months ... ;)
