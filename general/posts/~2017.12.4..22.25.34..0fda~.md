Fellow martians,

A short announcement: the Urbit Et Orbi blog previously hosted at http://urbitetorbi.org
is abandoning earthly technology: no more disqus comments, or similar outdated technologies.
We are transitioning to urbit-only technology starting today.

The blog is now available at address: http://blog.urbitetorbi.org/

We are all waiting for the new breach, which according to 77 intelligence agencies and unnamed senior Tlon officials is just around the corner!
After the breach expect detailed instructions on how to easily
host your own blog, and also customize it.

Urbit is already usable enough to slowly start moving our stuff (remember to backup...)
into the future. 

Best,

~ponmep-litsem

PS
Remember to checkout native comments on urbitetorbi. Not having to use disqus feels great.
