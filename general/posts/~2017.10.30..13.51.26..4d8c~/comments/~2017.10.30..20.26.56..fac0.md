~milrex, consider the following:

```
:-  3  6          ::  produces [3 6]
:-  3  (mul 2 3)  ::  also produces [3 6]
```

Both of those uses of `:-` result in the same cell (pair of nouns) of `[3 6]`. In the second example, `(mul 2 3)` may not be a value of itself, but it's an expression that can be evaluated to produce a value.

The trick to untangling data and code is realizing that code (through evaluation) produces/"becomes" data.

Does that make sense?
