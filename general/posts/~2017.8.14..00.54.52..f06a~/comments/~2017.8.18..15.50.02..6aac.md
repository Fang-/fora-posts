Storing security tokens via eyre is better because all other apps that want to access block.io can use the same token and oauth flow.

This is probably the smallest proper dojo UI app, which is great :p I looked into them a while ago but didn't really get how to work the lib/sole stuff. And, uh, for "The app will make transfers [...] as long as that message gets echoed back to you," impersonating other people in talk is fixed right? >.> Even then that doesn't seem secure, since messages aren't signed by their sender and the owner of the room can send whatever from whoever...

Something like a subscibe path in :talk that forwards all *sent* messages and not received might be good...
