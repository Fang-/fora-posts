## The Current Status of Doccords

(Or: I just wanted to call this "An Update on Doccords," but that has the same connotations as "Advancing Our Amazing Doccords" or "Our Incredible Doccord Journey". Sometimes, I hate Silicon Valley.)

The base patches to arvo and vere are still under review. The second patch, which copies documentation for layer 1 of `hoon.hoon` out of the docs repository and into doccords, has [a discussion about style][style] and how much information should go into doccords in practice.

Hot off the `git push` is the [final part][final]: the overview of the span.

    Hoon:
      +8191 : layer one: basic arithmetic, tree addressing and molds

    Libraries:
      ^test : The data structures of test.
       test : The implementation of test.

This currently walks through the span of the subject, piece by piece. Any documented libraries where are loaded are refereed to by their "lib-name" (or "^lib-name" in case of a collision, which happens often since `sur/` and `lib/` code tend to have the same names). Any piece of the standard library gets surfaced by axis.

I think the entire doccord system is now feature complete. Am I missing anything?
