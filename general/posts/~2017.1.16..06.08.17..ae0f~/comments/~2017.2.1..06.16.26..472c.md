## `~ponnys-podfer`
I think doccords are now done. The code is ready for review, and I've made [two][two] [pull][pull] requests for the arvo and urbit sides of this change. I'm pretty sure it needs some revision, but that's what code review is for!

To `~pittyp`'s question. I have a preference for `''':` to match `^:` which was to match the comment rune `::`. As for vertical space, the `''':` irregular form is flexible enough so all of these are equivalent:

    ''':
    First Line
    
    Second Line
    ''':
    
    ''':First Line
    
    Second Line
    ''':
    
    ''':
    First Line
    
    Second Line''':
    
    ''':First Line
    
    Second Line''':
    
I personally prefer the last of the four, though that might just be a python bias. I've also ensured that `\''':` properly escapes so you can embed examples of this irregular syntax inside.
