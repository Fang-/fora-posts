## `~ponnys-podfer`
Current state: You can now type `# +2047` and get a list of the arms on the layer one core in hoon.hoon. (And a core level comment if you add that in to hoon.hoon.) The arm output is also sorted now; I didn't know about `aor` when I started.

My initial thought was to cram this into a sig `nock 10` rune. `~sorreg` discouraged this since documentation wouldn't have any effect on the interpreter (and the only reason I proposed it in the first place was me not understanding spans), and I now think he's right.

I used `:` as the second part of the sigil to remind the user of comments. I didn't even think of cells.

I'm only using `#` as a placeholder; it's not final. I don't know what the final dojo syntax would be.

Regarding printing spans or molds: this looks like enough of a pain point that I should just punt this to version 2 (if that).

I'm open to only having documentation just at the top of cores and on arms, instead of on arbitrary twigs. I even have a prototype the does the arm bit (minus causing a nest-fail in ames that would have to be resolved). That said, I've found that doing non-trivial modification to preexisting jet code is rather hard and error prone. I can probably manage it if the consensus is that its the correct thing to do, but I'll need a bit of hand holding.
