Great work ~ponnys, and good choice of examples. (;

Using ^: for this feels a bit wrong, I would've expected a sig-hint rune. Going by the docs, ~: is still available.

Can you share your current implementation so we can take a look? Thanks!

As for Thou Shalt Doc, we'll just have to open issues on all code that doesn't comply.  
~sorreg might come and insist it be compiler-enforced though. (;
