## `~pittyp-datfyn`
Would it be vertically wasteful to enforce the same aligned-alone-on-line requirement that `'''` have? In particular I'm thinking of

```
++  boog
    ''':
    Processes the `''':` irregular form, e.g.
      ++  foo
          ''':
          some doc
          ''':
        implementation
    ''':
  ;~(pose ...)
```

which shouldn't e.g. syntax error on the second `` ` ``.

(Also `'''^` would imo be more clear, "a cord block which is a type annotation", but that's firmly in the realm of "implementer decides")
