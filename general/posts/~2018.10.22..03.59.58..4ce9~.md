So I was at an unspecified event this weekend.  It was an excellent time with some really interesting people.  I collected some random quotes, which I'm putting here without identifying the speaker or any surrounding context.

If you want a flavor of how the weekend went, read on!  If you want to contribute, there's a comment field at the bottom, although please observe Chatham House Rules.
