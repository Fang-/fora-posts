I have put up a [PR against the /docs repository](https://github.com/urbit/docs/pull/187) for adding an index page to the [standard library docs.](https://urbit.org/~~/docs/hoon/library/).

~palfun-foslup and I would appreciate it if you could peruse the PR and add any comments you may have.

Thanks!
