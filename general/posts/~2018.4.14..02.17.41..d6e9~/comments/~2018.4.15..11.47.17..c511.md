Can we get more authorized leaks on that mobile app?
Is it just mobile enabled website, or a 'real' full-blown app?

If the second, I would be afraid Urbit would be exposing itself to just being banned from the appstores of whatever BigCo. This was the fate that met all apps that promised to wrestle huge swathes of users out of Borgs control. While being banned in itself is a badge of honor, if we are certain of it, we can as well sidestep app stores altogether and instead offer it for download separately.
