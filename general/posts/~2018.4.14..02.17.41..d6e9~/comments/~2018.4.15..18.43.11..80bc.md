Well, I don't think this distinction carries much weight in the eyes of the Borg who will be tasked with censoring application. All social media apps are, in fact, clients for APIs. The would-be twitter competitor was banned of all platforms under some made up pretexts.

By not bothering to include it there in the first place we deny them the chance to score a PR points against Urbit.
