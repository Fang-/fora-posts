While this is insane and demented and completely wonderful, I just want to point out to anyone passing by that HOON DOES ALL THIS WORK FOR YOU!

Of course people haven't given up programming in assembly language, a very similar experience to this -- but there's a rational reason for that, which is that they can sometimes beat the compiler.  There is no sense in which your hand-rolled Nock is going to beat the Hoon compiler.  But...

There are also non-rational, or rather human, reasons for doing things like this.  One thing Hoon tries hard for is that C feeling of being just a macro assembler.  The transformation is as straightforward as possible, and I think it's pretty close to the C->assembly straightforwardness.  

C does this for performance reasons, of course.  But the sense of being close to the machine is aesthetically satisfying -- and this is true even for an abstract machine, like Nock.

Basically, when I write Hoon, I think of it as doing what `~taglux-nidsep` is doing.  I don't think in higher-level terms, at least not exclusively in higher-level terms -- I tend to visualize both sides of the transformation.  Obviously stretching your Nock muscles is a great way to build this skill.
