To view some of the documented known issues, take a look [on GitHub](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atalk).

There's also still some ongoing problems with internal message numbering, which may result in partial backlog loading in webtalk, or when joining a circle (urbit-meta likely has this problem). The exact cause is giving me the runaround, but I'll try to get a bandaid fix out soon.

If you experience anything weird, please shout into urbit-meta, post to GitHub, or both. Thanks for all the feedback!
