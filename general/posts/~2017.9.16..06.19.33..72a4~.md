If you take the view that the filesystem is a component that is primarily exposed to the programmer, today's filesystems aren't perfect but aren't terrible either. A programmer takes a filesystem as a component that they use to store their blobs. Let's say a programmer is building a music library application. They build the application on top of the filesystem, building an index of user supplied files and their metadata, then writing their database back to the the filesystem. Users interact with the application instead of the filesystem, because the filesystem is just a component for the programmer. The application writes its own index of the files it read back to the filesystem as its own file.

Anyone who's used an application in the last couple of decades has experienced the problems of this model: the point of a filesystem is to store your files and anything built on top of it like a band aid gets out of date as changes on the filesystem don't propagate to the application indices! It goes back as far as the database for the Unix locate command going stale. Move a file around, and now you can't play that MP3.

Again: What are filesystems for? They are not just components for programmers, they are tools for users.

Some operating systems made it easy to search over files. They kept more than the name and modification date; they allowed storing arbitrary key/value pairs on files as part of the filesystem interface along with making per-filesystem indices of attribute keys, allowing for instant searching. This is not new technology; BeOS' Be Filesystem had indices over arbitrary attributes in the 1990s.

This is not a screenshot of the BeOS contact program. *It's a screenshot of their File Manager.* In the above screenshot of BeOS Tracker, I'm looking at a directory of contact files. Since the filesystem tracks these properties, their file manager knows what properties to surface. Their contact editing app worked on one contact at a time because the operating system was designed so you could search your data, so why build in a redundant search engine which will get out of sync with the canonical source? All these files are in one directory, but they don't need to be. You could have complex database queries on the filesystem and then view them as folders!

(BeOS Tracker is also blindingly fast. We have forgotten how to write fast software and that makes me sad.)

Obviously, I'm not here (merely) to gush about BeOS. As implemented, it had problems. Attributes weren't automatically extracted from files because file contents were still untyped octet streams; attributes needed to be written separately by the application that created the file. If only their files were typed.

%clay files are already strongly typed with a mark which provides type conversion and patching semantics for the file. I suggest adding key/value pair extraction for metadata. Longer term, add indexing directly into %clay to keep people from building their own ad-hoc indices which will invariably get out of sync with the filesystem, though, as [the clay blog post](https://urbit.org/blog/clay/) says, this shouldn't be done yet.

*(This was inspired by several recent incidents. Such as my music player's index of my files diverging from the filesystem. Again. And .DS_Store and Thumbs.db files littering my linux boxen. And Window Explorer refusing to delete directories because Windows Explorer has leaked a file descriptor to a Thumbs.db file. And...)*
