## `~fodwyt-nimbus`
lacmec: ++ut wasn't easy, but the partial memoization it uses wasn't too hard to capture once i understood what it was doing. jaque has jets that implement this memoization, and run the nock for the empy-cache case. There were a couple of other minor issues, but relatively few all things considered.

~taglux, I'm not aware of any such plan, but I'd certainly like to make that an option. It will be a little while before jaque is as mature/tested as vere though, even once it hits feature completion.
