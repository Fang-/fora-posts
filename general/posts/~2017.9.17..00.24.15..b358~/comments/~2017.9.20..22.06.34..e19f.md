jaque is an experimental jvm implementation of the urbit executable (http://github.com/frodwith/jaque), and is my pet project. it's not really relevant to the conversation other than to say "this isn't a crazy idea, necessarily." jaque's effect dispatching would make this trivial, as it already uses a pubsub model. vere (the urbit executable) could do it also, it would just be a little more work.

the dojo has a sort of running context that the expressions you type into it are evaluated in. i think that solves your "big bang" concern, but I'm not sure I entirely understand what you mean here. Your comment about partial evaluation is particularly fluxing, since I actually thing partial evaluation opportunities abound for hoon/nock, but... hmm.

An urbit text editor is the real answer to your yearning for a better hoon development environment, but alas that has to wait until arvo's terminal effect system is upgraded to include ncurses-like functionality, and that's been postponed for the moment. doccords, however, are coming in cc-release if I'm not mistaken, and access to that sort of thing via the python client would be the route i would choose for editor integration at the moment. The python client is certainly up to sending pokes from unix.
