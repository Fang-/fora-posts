`+>` is lark syntax for `+7`; the tail of tail of the subject. That's the address where the context of a core is.

A cell is a binary tree of nouns, and we can navigate it to arbitrary depths through a sequence of head/tail selections. `-` and `<` mean *head*, `+` and `>` mean tail. They are alternated for visual clarity.

A core is `[code data]`, so the data part is always +3. But a core with a sample (a gate or a door) has two different kinds of data: the sample, and the context (the subject against which the core was defined). So it's `[code [sample context]]`; the sample is `+6` or `+<`, the context is `+7` or `+>`.

Consider this:

```
> =(. (|=(* +>)))
%.y
```

But if you change the subject (construct a new subject with changes, technically), the context of your core won't necessarily be at `+7` anymore.

```
> =(. (|=(* =+(a=1 +>))))
nest-fail
```

What you really want is +7 against the core itself, not +7 against the subject of your twig:

```
> =(. (|=(* =+(a=1 +>.$))))
%.y
```
