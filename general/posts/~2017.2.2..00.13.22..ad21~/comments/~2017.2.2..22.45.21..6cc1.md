## `~palfun-foslup`
I can mostly follow that, and can even recognize it within talk's code. Still not exactly grokking it though, for some reason my head is refusing to cooperate.

If we look at [`++ra-fora-post`](https://github.com/urbit/arvo/blob/master/app/talk.hoon#L1399), we see it does `=.  ..some-arm  %+  some-arm  args` occasionally. Judging from the things the arms it does that for produce, `..some-arm` refers to the context of that arm?
