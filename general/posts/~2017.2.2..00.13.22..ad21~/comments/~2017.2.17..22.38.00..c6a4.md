## `~palfun-foslup`
I'm happy to say that with special thanks to ~digser (aka ~master-marzod) for helping me out, the prompt breaking [has been fixed](https://github.com/Fang-/arvo/commit/31951c54da1ee4b9ba463a42b724ae6a5d9dd1bf)!

It still does not send pokes to remote ships however. Just to be sure this isn't a fakenet thing I also tested this between two comets on the live network. No dice.  
Guess I'll have to either get down and dirty, or wait until cc-release and hope that fixes whatever is happening here. I'm kind of leaning towards the latter, it seems it won't be too long from now, and I'd rather spend what time I have doing slightly more productive things. Who knows though, maybe something will inspire me.
