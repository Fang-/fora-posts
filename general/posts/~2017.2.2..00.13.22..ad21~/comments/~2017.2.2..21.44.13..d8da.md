"contains the data we're working on" That's done by using a core with sample `|_` right? What do you mean with "the effects we're trying to produce"? The different things the core's arms do?

I think I understand these, and I can see what `=^` does now. Helps explain `++poke-talk-command`, which I now understand reads as "call `++ra-apply`, store the result and update our state/core(?), then do the same for `++log-all-to-file`, and finally produce all the moves out calls created". Correct?

That answers some of my questions, but I still have no idea how to go about doing what I want. I think I want to do `ra-abet:(ra-poll:ra things)` in my `++poke-talk-poll-action`, and have `++ra-poll` spit out a list of moves and a new `++ra` core, and I think I maybe want to call `++ra-consume` from within `++ra-poll` to take care of sending a message for me, but I don't actually know for sure and I can't get it to compile anyway.  
Bleh.

A big thing tripping me up is `+>` and how I'm never sure what it's actually referring to. Same for `+>.$` too, I suppose. Thought I got a handle on this some time ago, but apparently not? Or I'm just looking at it wrong, idk.
