Please be a troll, every single time a CoC has been introduced it's either at best done nothing and at worst wounded the project.

Everyone who calls for a CoC uses it ex post facto, you're screwed for past think.
Don't have one, don't even have one as a joke lest the reason why it's there is forgotten, just like how no one remembers why /bin and /usr/bin came about no one will remember that the CoC was a joke.
