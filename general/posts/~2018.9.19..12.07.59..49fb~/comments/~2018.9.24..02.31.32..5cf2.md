~habfel_dopzod, while I do not believe that code has intrinsic value, I think that code can be valuable if it helps people, who I do believe have intrinsic value. In the same vein, I do not believe that food has intrinsic value, but that it is valuable when it is feeding people. I hope this clarifies the previous post. And too reiterate, ~habfel, maybe you have a different value system. That is fine; I have no intention of implying mine is the only admissible value system.
