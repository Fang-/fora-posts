>> Some of you may have seen that Linux recently adopted a new code of conduct, a process which I played a part in.

Successfully so, that Linux now is now going up in flames.  Linus Torvalds himself is being pushed out of his own creation, by this "inclusive" SJW conduct.  

Remember, SJW's always lie.  When xir says "inclusive developer community", he means actually "excluding every developer who actually has a damn idea how to code."
