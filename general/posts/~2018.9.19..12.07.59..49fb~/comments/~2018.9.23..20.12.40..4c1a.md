I think ~tapfed (among others) makes a fair point about the efficacy of CoCs. That said, I think that many of the dissenters in this thread are doing so with unnecessary vitriol. Additionally, I think that many decrying the political motives of CoCs in this thread have also included very partisan accusations in their comments. I don't think you can in good faith decry the political nature of a proposal while making political accusations.
The Post-Meritocracy Manifesto makes many good points. I do not believe code has intrinsic value, but that it derives its value from person's intrinsic value. Perhaps your moral code doesn't place value in persons, but in power, aesthetics, politics, or something else. That's fair. But I think everyone would be better served if you explained the ethical origination or your qualms before diving into ad hominem "bluehaird trans" accusations.
