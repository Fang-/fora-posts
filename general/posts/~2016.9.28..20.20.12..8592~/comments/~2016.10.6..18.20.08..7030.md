Okay, I really hate this bug.  Curtis hit it last night on his laptop â€” but it's somehow impossible for me to reproduce.

I was on a different Chrome version, but I updated and now we're on the same one.  Incognito mode, no dice.  Log out, follow your instructions, can't do it.  

I believe this is real.  I think it might be an eventListener thing.  Like, we aren't cleaning something up properly after we navigate.  I'll see if another machine here in the office can reproduce.
