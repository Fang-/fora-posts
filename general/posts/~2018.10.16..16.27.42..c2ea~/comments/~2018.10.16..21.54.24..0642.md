Writing a better Nock interpreter/jit or a way to formally verify jets seem like the obvious picks.

Currently the interpreter is just a naive tree reducer, with two toyish implementations of a jit by community members that I know of (a common lisp one, and another using Truffle/Graal).

As for jets, they're currently 1) in C with *very* minimal type support 2) have no automatic checking that they're equivalent to Hoon 3) manually reference counting nouns. This is a pretty obvious problem.

Other projects I can think of would be adding DHT support for handshaking with comets instead of going through ~zod, some kind of multithreading model like which was mentioned in Proposals, or writing another language that targets Nock instead of only Hoon.
