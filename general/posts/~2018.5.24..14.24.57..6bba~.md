Hi, I was using Urbit in 2017 but there was nothing to do and I switched laptops.

I'm trying to recover my planet. I'm running `urbit -w wisseg-bosmeg -t my-invite-code`.

The setup seems to get stuck at this part:

    ; ~zod not responding still trying
    <awaiting hood, this may take a few minutes>

Does anyone know what I should do next?
