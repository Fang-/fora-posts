Often when deconstructing a kelp, you write something like

    ?-  val
      {$stem *}  ...
      {$steb *}  ...
      {$stec *}  ...
    ==

and also, frequently, `?=({$stem *} val)`. I find the :fits a bit visually distasteful, and chains (not much longer than 3) of these in a `?-` make me want to `?-(-.val ...)` instead, which has different semantics and doesn't work for compositions of `$%` with `$^`, `$@`, et al.

One solution would be an irregular syntax for writing molds of this type. As ray suggested, we already have `leaf+"tank"` for `[%leaf "tank"]`, so perhaps a syntax mirroring this using ~. `leaf~*` for {$leaf *}, or simply `leaf~` and default to *. Postfix `~` is already taken (although mostly reviled), but this could replace that or another character could be used.

Does {$stem *} get on your nerves at times as well? Please leave your thoughts on both the problem and the solution.
