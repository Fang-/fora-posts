This demo is really great. And it seemed everyone else in our `:talk` conversation the other day thought so as well. It's clear you put a lot of work into this given the size of the app files alone. There's no doubt a decent amount of this can be simplified and improved style-wise (really our fault for not having a public style guide, which we've been actively working on finalizing and publishing). But nonetheless, this is super cool considering you figured all this out on your own (how long have you been learning this stuff, and when did you find out about Urbit?)

If you haven't already, you should check out my new Urbit examples `:fora` post, give some feedback on that and try to make it a goal to get your `:wiki` app in there. I think with some minor refactoring and a touch of CSS, this could be a really great example for people to have. And if you have ideas about how to improve things even more, let me know!

What do you think was the hardest part of learning and building this? We're always looking for feedback to help improve Hoon and the Arvo vane interfaces, and especially our docs which have bene severely subpar.
