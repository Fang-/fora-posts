Unimaginatively called String. Code is [here](https://github.com/Fang-/urbit-string/blob/master/lib/string.hoon). (WIP warning)

After copying the file, include with `/+  string` and call as follows: `(~(func string "mystring") "opt. arg")`

Tapes go in and (generally) tapes come out. Cords are cool but not practical for manipulation.

I have never before written a library. Let me know what's good/wrong about the general setup, and what kind of functionality you'd like to see. For now I've implemented a couple of things that I recalled wanting during talkbot's development and functions I found in other string libraries.  
Of course I'm also taking library name suggestions.

For functions which are already in the standard library, I have included their usage as comments in String's code.
