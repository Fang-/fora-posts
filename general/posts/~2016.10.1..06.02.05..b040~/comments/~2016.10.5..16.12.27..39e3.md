## `~master-morzod`
Thanks for writing this up! I'd never seen or used Instruments before -- pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to get started.

Instruments is a stand-alone app on OS X, and has been for at least several versions. Here are the steps that I followed:

- Open "Instruments" via spotlight
- Select the "time profiler" template
- `cat fake-zod/.vere.lock` to get the PID of my already-running fake ~zod
- Click "All Processes", select System Process/More... and scan till I find the urbit with my PID
- Click "record"

Alternately, you can choose a Profiling Target binary to start. Using that with the [dry-run option (`-D`)](/fora/posts/~2016.8.4..18.55.55..6770~/) offers a path to reproducible traces, or maybe even a good way to test binary changes against a single event log.

FWIW, there's also a commandline `instruments` app ....
