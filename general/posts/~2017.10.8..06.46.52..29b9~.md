```
~poldec-tonteg+ i don't understand what ++abet does
~fodwyt-nimbus+ many cores are written as state-machine things, where 
~fodwyt-nimbus+ "side-effect"-ing arms return something like [result new-core]. 
~fodwyt-nimbus+ ++abet is a conventional arm for getting the "final result" of 
~fodwyt-nimbus+ this type of core.

~poldec-tonteg+ is there a good minimal example of this?
~savfex_macned  wrote some words about doors in general before
~savfex_macned+ spoiler alert, i'm bad at tutorials
~savfex_macned/ http://sprunge.us/CWKR
~savfex_macned+ the secret is that doors are just objects :o

~barpub-tarber+ that reads like a closure
~barpub-tarber+ unmatched paren in the second `this` fyi
~savfex_macned+ people learning hoon without learning about =^ breaks my heart
~rophex-hashes+ what does (sum:obj 4) do? maybe it should be plus:obj?
~savfex_macned+ uh, yes it should be

~rophex-hashes+ otherwise a very good explanation
~rophex-hashes+ also is . always equivalent to +>.$ ? i think someone explained
~rophex-hashes+ to me once that it might not
~littel-ponnys+ . is your current subject
~savfex_macned+ uh, depends on what `$` is

~savfex_macned+ if you have a loop then you need +>.^$ for example, to get the
~savfex_macned+ context of the top-most gate
~savfex_macned+ and if you aren't in a gate at all, you need +>
~rophex-hashes+ so the definition of ++ this is to avoid things like ^$ ?
~rophex-hashes+ yes that was it

~savfex_macned+ in that, if ++reset tried to use +>.$ it would error because
~savfex_macned+ there is no $ arm it's running under because it's not a gate
~rophex-hashes+ aha! got it now. those arms are returning a modified core
~rophex-hashes+ without using a gate
~savfex_macned+ yeah

~savfex_macned+ they don't need to take an argument, so no need for a function
~savfex_macned+ :)
~rophex-hashes+ this is very elegant using similar syntax whether an arm is a
~rophex-hashes+ gate or not
~savfex_macned+ yeah, cores are neat like that

~savfex_macned+ ++  x  1
~savfex_macned+ when you access `x` it actually is a lambda that returns 1
~savfex_macned+ they're computed properties, not values
~savfex_macned+ so ++  plus  |=  num/@ ...
~savfex_macned+ is actually a lambda that *returns a function*

~savfex_macned+ accessing plus:obj calls the lambda, returning the newly build
~savfex_macned+ function, and you call it
~savfex_macned+ this is why stuff like $ works, and why we use $(a b) to recurse
~savfex_macned+ instead of calling the same function again like most languages
~savfex_macned+ you don't actually have to worry about that

~savfex_macned+ except to know that, like
~savfex_macned+ ++  dub  (mul sum 2) in that summer example
~savfex_macned+ would evaluate (mul sum 2) when you access it
~savfex_macned+ instead of being stuck at 0 when you first create the object and
~savfex_macned+ never being updated

~savfex_macned+ which is why `abet` and `this` work, too
~savfex_macned is probably just making any confusion worse?
~rophex-hashes+ it's lazy evaluating the call to mul?
~savfex_macned+ not lazy evaluation as much that arms in cores are methods, not
~savfex_macned+ properties

~rophex-hashes+ yeah that makes sense
~rophex-hashes+ i've always thought of them as computed properties, but the
~rophex-hashes+ fact they are computed every time i didn't realize
~savfex_macned+ yeah
~rophex-hashes+ but it makes sense now

~fodwyt-nimbus+ a bit like javascript objects if they were immutable
~fodwyt-nimbus+ foo.bar = function() { ... }
~savfex_macned+ like, if add recursed with (add (dec a) +(b)) instead of 
~savfex_macned+ $(a (dec a), b +(b))
~savfex_macned+ it would be re-emitting the entire gate each time

~savfex_macned+ and calling a new copy
~fodwyt-nimbus+ it's doing that anyway
~savfex_macned+ instead of only re-running the $ arm within the same core
~rophex-hashes+ i think in javascript that might close over the current value
~rophex-hashes+ in definition instead of call time, no?

~savfex_macned+ uu?
~fodwyt-nimbus+ savfex: the %= that that $(a...) is boiling down to essentially 
~fodwyt-nimbus+ is creating the same mutant core that the call would be
~fodwyt-nimbus+ isn't it?
~fodwyt-nimbus+ rophex: it's not a perfect metaphor

~fodwyt-nimbus+ just an intution
~fodwyt-nimbus+ intu...ition.
~savfex_macned+ nope! (add a b) would be =+  f=add:.  ~($ f [a b])
~rophex-hashes+ sorry ;-p
~savfex_macned+ it reevaluates the add arm remember, which is essentially a

~savfex_macned+ lambda that returns the actual gate
~fodwyt-nimbus+ oh you mean reproducing the add core
~fodwyt-nimbus+ i gotcha
~savfex_macned+ yup
~savfex_macned+ in practice it wouldn't matter that much, since it's a tail-call

~savfex_macned+ anyways
~savfex_macned+ but it's still something neat to think about
~fodwyt-nimbus+ how about ($ a b)?
~savfex_macned+ $ isn't a gate
~fodwyt-nimbus+ i guess that doesn't work

~savfex_macned+ (f) is pulling the arm $ in core f
~fodwyt-nimbus+ should clarify, i see why it doesn't work
~fodwyt-nimbus+ i'm just thinking out....loud?
~savfex_macned+ cool
~savfex_macned thinks this stuff is neat
