It's not strictly necessary that the address space hierarchy be used for all parts of managing reputation.  That is, other people on the network can attest to the reputation of another node on some kind of a shared list.  Lists like that would make it much easier on operators of network infrastructure.  

The other thing worth bearing in mind is that there's a built in cost to any abuser of the network.  As in, addresses actually have some cost to acquire.  This cost is trivial for Twitter, but should never be for Urbit.  That alone should improve the overall civility of the network.
