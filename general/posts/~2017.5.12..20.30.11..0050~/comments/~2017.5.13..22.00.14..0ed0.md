~rigler, I'm glad to read your reply, particularly the part about the Red bit. It confirms for me that we are operating in the same universe, at least, which is deeply comforting. Ax 5 is daring, to be sure, and justifying it is the hardest part of writing a polemic for Ax which will stick the landing.

To the rest of your reply, I can only say that when I read my own commentary, I am not persuaded. When I watch the video, I am more nearly persuaded, but not fully! I can only reiterate my apology for being tardy in getting my act together.
