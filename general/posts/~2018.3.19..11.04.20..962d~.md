Hi team,

I was wondering what (financial?) incentives one has by owning a galaxy or star? I am not talking about trading on exchanges or any of that crypto hype talk; I am more interested in better understanding what TYPE of services a galaxy/star could offer to get a better understanding and maybe even create hypothetical models, etc. Maybe a "real life" example if that's somehow possible haha ;)

Thanks for the info!
