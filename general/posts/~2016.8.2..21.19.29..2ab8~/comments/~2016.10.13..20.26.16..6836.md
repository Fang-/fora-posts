That reminds me, I meant to note that this design allows styles basically everywhere -- the exception is *in the buffer itself*. I haven't thought about it too much, but, if it's a necessary feature, it strikes me that `++sole-share` might need an additional, "presentational" buffer.

An alternative for syntax errors would be to simply print the highlighted error, and preserve the current behavior in the buffer.
