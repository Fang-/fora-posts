I was wrong about the `termios` config; something else must've been obstructing my style-rendering PoC. (Embarrassingly enough, I've been putting this off since I dreaded digging into the `termios` config ...)

Here's a simple test to prove it:

Add the following to `_term_it_show_wide()` in `term.c`, somewhere around line 565:

```
_term_it_write_str(uty_u, "\n\033[49m\033[31mfoo\033[49m\033[39m\033[49m\033[32mbar\033[49m\033[39m\033[49m\033[34mbaz\033[49m\033[39m\n");
```

`make`, and restart, and you'll see `foobarbaz` print in glorious RGB.

Or, to simulate the effect in bash:

```
printf '%b\n' '\033[49m\033[31mfoo\033[49m\033[39m\033[49m\033[32mbar\033[49m\033[39m\033[49m\033[34mbaz\033[49m\033[39m' 
```

I think the most pressing next step is to determine the appropriate `dill-blit` changes, and get them into `vere` and `%zuse`. That way, the changes can be made simple, backwards-incompatible, and folded into the upcoming %newames, %150, etc. release. (and dare I dream of removing the old `++blit`?)

I propose `{$out p/stub}` and `{$pro p/stub}` -- I don't see the point in a separate `$klr` blit, since the prompt will need to support styles.

To recap: `++stub` is a list of styled `(list @c)` (the `++styx` tree is flattened, and inherited styles are reified):

```
++  styd  (pair (set deco) (pair tint tint))            ::  decos/bg/fg
++  stub  (list (pair styd (list @c)))                  ::  styled tuba
```

Is that a good fit, or should it be made more generic for easy terminal processing? (perhaps `(list deco)` instead?)

Does it make sense to get the Arvo/terminal interfaces defined and implemented first?
