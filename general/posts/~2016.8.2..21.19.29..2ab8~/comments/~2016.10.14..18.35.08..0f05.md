1.  Duh.  That's my fault for bad naming.

2. It can do exactly what ++win:re does, without the line splitting.  Its goal is to render things flat and unsplit wherever possible.  

As for $rose and $palm, I felt this area was overdesigned.  I am in truth not exactly sure what is the best way to render a ++tanq -- whoever does the work gets to make the choice.

3. That's an interesting point.  I suppose operational transformation on a styled text is a little trickier, and the styled text is not actually content -- the content is just text, the style is commentary on that text.  We're not using the styled text box to actually generate styled content.  So you're probably right.

(1). Either way, up to you.

(2). My feeling is that term.c is the right place to do it, but this change can't be made until the next continuity breach (cc-release probably).
