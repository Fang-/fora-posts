More excellent stuff here!

One: remember that when sending cards to Unix, we can update Urbit with a wave of our magic wands, but updating Unix is much more nontrivial.  We don't have any mechanism for updating the interpreter, of course.

That's why it seems like a much easier path if you can produce an Urbit that works, by hook or by crook, with the current term.c.  We can clean up any hacks along this path on the cc-release branch.  But it therefore must be {$out (list @c)} and {$pro (list @c)}.  The good news is that term.c doesn't validate these characters before it prints them.  (Or has someone discovered a clever way around this problem, and I've just missed it?)

Two: yes, the ++tanq engine should render to ++stub.  It should still optimize for a given width, but never insert its own linebreaks.  Playing well with Unix is good.

Three: I agree that the buffer itself should be styled -- there are plenty of use cases for this.  Much UI feedback can go along this path.

Four: (Why ++styd, when ++stye is a word?)  I would say a set, and here's why: if you make it a list, in practice you don't know the semantics of someone trying to print a list with duplicates, lists in different orders, etc.  It's very easy for little incompatibilities to creep in this way.  Also, it's super easy to tap a set from C.

Did I miss anything?
