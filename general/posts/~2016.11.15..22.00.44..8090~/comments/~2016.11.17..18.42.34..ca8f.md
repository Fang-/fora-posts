>Instead of reinventing the wheel, we already have tmux

If I understand you correctly you'd just use tmux to run multiple instances of an urbit, or multiple instances of a wrapper application that uses urb. I think a native (to Arvo) solution would be much preferred here. We have cool tech, why not build cool thing for it instead of around it?

>What I had imagined was basically similar to the way `screen` works with the 'hard status' option on.

For those that don't use screen (which includes myself), the `hardstatus` option makes a status bar permanently appear on the bottom of the screen, displaying window name etc.

>It could be listening to an app, or a specific path within an app.

I had originally imaged apps just creating tabs for themselves, but this seems a lot more flexible! (It might still be nice for apps to be able to create tabs on-demand, but idk.) Then probably have a "master tab" (where all output appears regardless of source) as a 0th, permanent tab.
