Yeah, I don't see us moving away from Unix any time soon either.

Urbit should be able to run in daemon mode.  This is a change we'd like to make.  Also making it such that you could link to an individual urbit app makes sense to me.  

If we implement daemon mode, and allow linking to an individual app, you can use normal Unix tools to get the same effect as building a screen / tmux equivalent within Urbit.  The problem is, you have to configure this setup yourself.  I do think that the multiple screens configuration is probably the right way to use Urbit from the CLI, so I'd like to make it the default.  

I guess I'd like to support both options here.  The work to be done to make Urbit actually support daemon mode isn't that difficult.  That can be done first (any takers?).  Almost all the work is in `vere`.  Separating app output is a `drum` change, but Curtis tells me it's not too difficult.
