We're definitely exploring console improvements -- to some extent it's gated on some UI design work we're doing right now.

No one is really a fan of mixed output, although you do want infinite console scrollback.  Ideally, we can maintain a screen switching model and put all output that scrolls off any screen into the scrollback buffer above it.  This might involve some heavy terminfo magic, though.

Another interesting question is whether we stick to output only except the prompt line, or whether we give apps curses-style access (probably less optimized for 300-baud lines ;-) to a full text matrix.  term.c needs this power to do screen switching, but does it need to be in Urbit?  The principle of least power might apply here...

Has anyone used the C textbox library?  Curses is ancient...
