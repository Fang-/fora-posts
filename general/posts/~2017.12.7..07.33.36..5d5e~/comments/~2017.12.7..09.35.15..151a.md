Also, maybe I should emphasize that it is not about making Urbit dependent on any particular frontend technology. 
We all know, Urbit is specifically independent of any of that.

Urbit developers will always be able to choose any technology they like. On the other hand, Urbit community has the added advantage that at this stage we have not made significant code investments into any particular framework. We might as well take advantage of that :-)
