A question on calling arms on doors in a vase. Currently, I understand how to dynamically dispatch a gate in a core passed as a vase:

```
> =c |%  ++  name  |=(a/@ a)  --
> (slam (slap !>(c) [%limb %name]) !>(5))
[#t/@ q=5]
```

But I don't know how to lift the sample from the inner gate to the sample of the door, so that the arm doesn't contain a gate:

```
> =x |_  a/@  ++name  a  --
> ???
```

Assume I have x in a vase. What do I do to dynamically do `~(name x 5)`?
