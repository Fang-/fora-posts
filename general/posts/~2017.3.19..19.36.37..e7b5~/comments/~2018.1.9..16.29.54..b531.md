Excellent work ponnys !

Slightly off topic , but here is sth related to app testing after the runtime crash occurred.

Imagine that every time an app crashed, Gall pokes %bugs with a state of the app at the moment (auto sanitizing sensitive info) of the crash and last event, and sends it to the author, who views it inside our customers bugzilla program, which also is integrated with the test system. I see amazing potential for having a github killer, at least for Hoon ;>
