maybe I'm misunderstanding you but I think you should be able to use /: to set the directory and then /_ to get all files in there

`/=  all-tests  /:  /===/tests  /_  /!noun/`

recursion shouldn't be to hard to add to this though I can't immediately think of how without taking a closer look at the code. something involving relative paths and `/|` to optionally run the tests if they're there
