I'm not that sure why you need another Ford scry. Can't you just do something like +tree to get all Hoon files, and %make them?

The problem I see is that you can't write tests for your actual app code, only libraries. If Gall had a scry that gave the entire app state, core and all, you could use that though - functional purity is a helluva thing, so you can run arms from the "live" version just fine. Probably replacing the state with a blank, though, for determinisricality.

I'd definitely say to use a door for the test suite, so that all your arms don't have to take t/super-long-type. You wouldn't even need a gate at that point, just "++test-add  (expect-eq (add 2 2) 4 "message")" if you don't put a face on the door sample.
