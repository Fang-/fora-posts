The primary difference is that examples are one liners which compare the output of a function, and traditional unit testing can be arbitrarily complex.

Right now, the `(expect-eq (add 2 2) 4 "on error print me")` is a trivial case and would unlikely to be seen in real code. Consider a state machine: a test would be one path through the state machine, and you would have multiple expectation statements between each call to the state machine.
