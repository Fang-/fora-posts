I don't think there's a gate in the kernel for this, so you have to piece it together:

```
(slap (slop !>((sy %a %b %c ~)) !>(..in)) [%open [%wyt ~] [%limb %in] [[%$ 2] ~]])
```

That's roughly equivalent to

```
~(wyt in (sy %a %b %c ~))
```

Our subject is a cell of our set and the core containing in:

```
 (slop !>((sy %a %b %c ~)) !>(..in))
```

You can also make this work with a more minimal vase:

```
(slap (slop !>((sy %a %b %c ~)) !>(in)) [%open [%wyt ~] [%$ 3] [[%$ 2] ~]])
```
