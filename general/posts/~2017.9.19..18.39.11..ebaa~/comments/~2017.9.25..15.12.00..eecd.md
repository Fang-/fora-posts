## `~master-morzod`
`~taglux`, you're not confused. "Impossible" is hyperbole -- technically incorrect, but practically accurate (at least with a good hash function). "Unique" is absolutely wrong: the domain of a hash function is infinite, and the range is 0 to 2<sup>x</sup>-1, where x is the bitwidth of the hash function output (256 bits in `~fitseb`'s example). As `~dabewl` notes, a good has function widely distributes collisions in such a way that they are very difficult to find. Finding a computationally-feasible mechanism for generating collisions with a given hash function *breaks the security* of that function. See "collision attack" or "preimage attack" for details.
