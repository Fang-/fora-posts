~barpub maybe I'm misunderstanding what you mean here but I don't think it's as simple as you make it sound. One reason to desire deleting or expiring data is for legal reasons. Something that eventually urbit will have to be concerned with.


If your answer to the court is that the data is *still* there but unaccessible because the code won't let you see it then the court will just tell you to rewrite the code. Right now you can truly delete it by truncating your log and deleting it from the app state. Then you can reasonably tell the court that the data is gone and not retrievable.


However, if %gall is storing diffs of that data automatically for you with no way to turn it off then you can't tell the court that.
