Echoing `~rovnys`'s comment, we're working hard to be more consistent with fresh master pill uploads. This process will soon be fully automated. 

In the meantime, I should add that sometime's you'll hit the case when you do need to boot from an old pill, but you don't want to go through the process of running `+solid` and waiting for a fresh fake `~zod` to boot an additional time from that fresh pill. If you just need a quick `~zod` with the latest master Arvo, but the latest master pill on `bootstrap.urbit.org` is old, after booting from the old pill with your latest `-A arvo` checkout, you can run `|reset` in the Dojo. This will reload the ship with the newer Hoon, Zuse and vanes that got copied in with `-A` (but weren't loaded because the current boot process loads directly from the pill, not the `-A arvo` source code).

Feel free to comment if any of this is confusing. I'll push out some updates to the `contributing.md` docs in the coming weeks.
