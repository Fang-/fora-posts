Is the whole thing pointing out to the need of rethinking Urbits cryptographic system? Even if Urbit does contain security issue, the damage would be contained if some form of revocation, multi-signatures, temporary keys, and off-line private keys were employed.

Until a robust and practical cryptographic stack is ready, I would rather live in a semi-centralized world where Tlon does safe-guard Urbit transactions as a second factor or something like that, rather than introduce an external entity. 

I expect Ethereum to be a blockchain, that if moderatly succesful will quickly fall under government control.
