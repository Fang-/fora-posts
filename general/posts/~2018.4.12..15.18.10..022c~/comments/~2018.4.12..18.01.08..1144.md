The main stumbling point, for me, when trying to follow a reasonably complex example like, say, https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/http/  is purely an issue of layout. Having the 'working text' right at the top and then bulky (but very useful) line by line explanation below it leads to a lot of scrolling up and down, trying to find you place in the explanation again, etc, which breaks the flow.

Simply having the example in a separate side bar (because good hoon is narrow, not wide, right? ) or a nice "open code in new window" button would greatly reduce the steepness of the on ramp IMHO.
