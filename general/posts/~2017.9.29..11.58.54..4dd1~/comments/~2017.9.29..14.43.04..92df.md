Nice!  While I was deep in `js` development a while back I wrote something like this as well.  When you're working out of a separate git repo, this is really the way to go.  Especially while ships still explode from time to time.

I always meant to release the script I used.  It always felt like the kind of thing someone else should have already written â€” but I couldn't ever find a solution.  I think one of the `node` build tools will do it now.  Maybe `webpack`?
