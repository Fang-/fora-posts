I agree that we don't need to make a choice between reactive docs and `%gall` app documentation.

But the argument for prioritizing reactive docs seems to be that teaching reactive docs will prime the pump for an Urbit publishing community. That’s something that would be nice to cultivate for when our app systems are ready for primetime. 

Another argument, which I think you will agree with, is that creating early-on documentation for reactive docs will seed a community of people familiar with Sail. Having that will create positive feedback that’s critical for augmenting and revising those very same tutorials and improving the system. I can’t speak for you, but I don’t know how to create a computed document in any language. Some learners will bring useful prior knowledge, but we need to get them involved first. 

We already have docs about `%gall`, even if they aren’t very good. Some folks at Tlon are working on things `%gall`-related, and some community members have certainly encountered the module, too.  The same is not true for Hoon-powered reactive docs. So we have one resource right now and not the other. That should inform our doc-writing agenda.
