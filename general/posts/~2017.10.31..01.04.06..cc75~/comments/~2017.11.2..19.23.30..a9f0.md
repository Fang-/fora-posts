Really? I'd expect it to be pretty blazing, tbh. Modifying the returned view would trigger copy-on-write tree editing, so finding dirty subtrees would be a pointer comparison with the old one (or mug). Otherwise it's pretty much just stealing React's algorithm.

Hell, it's the terminal (which is comparatively tiny), and we're already using ncurses to set noupdate mode. You could just redraw the entire UI and let ncurses update modified cells like it normally does.
