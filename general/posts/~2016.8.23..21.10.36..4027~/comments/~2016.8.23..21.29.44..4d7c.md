The original idea behind `web.plan` and the root page was that it would be sort of a cross between keybase and a profile.

That is: you'd have one place to link your accounts (using the API connectors we have) and create some kind of cryptographic proof of ownership.  Additionally, your `.plan` would carry arbitrary metadata about you that other apps could use to identify you.  'Real name', 'nickname', etc.  Eventually it'd be even better if these things had access controls — but that opens up an even bigger question about how to do access control in `%clay`. 

We had looked at using `web.plan` values for `:talk` nicknames.  I think the "real" way to solve this was actually sketched out in a new vane, called `%khan` that would hold contact data.  Contacts should really work more like a phone book — and less like Facebook.  That is, you can locally annotate / override contact details.  Like you do in your phone.

Curtis can provide some guidance on what the right architecture is.  Anton and I worked together on the `.plan` stuff.  

Either way, I agree that a ship name is more or less like a phone number.  It's relatively easy to remember — but shouldn't be the primary identifier.  I think this especially obvious post-great-renaming when none of us recognize each other anymore.  This is the experience of being a noob, and it's super confusing.
