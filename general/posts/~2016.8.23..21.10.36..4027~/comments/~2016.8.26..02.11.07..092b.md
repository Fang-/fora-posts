Normies is basically a bad word, in my opinion.  It should be avoided.  Secret code names are fun for some, annoying for others.  I think the idea that the preference is controlled by each person is a mistake.  If I want to see `:talk` with real names, I should.  Someone else could only display urbit names.  

The reader (normie, geek, whatever) wants a harmonized, predictable experience.  Not one that basically encourages participants to inject noise into their identifiers to grab attention.  Urbit names can be a great way to identify people in some contexts, but it can also be confusing.  I find that I can remember about six urbit names, and everyone else just runs together.  Mostly because I have to remember who the name actually identifies, and that's too much work.  I hate memorization.  It's just not for everyone.
