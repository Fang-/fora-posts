Very interesting work ~mistyc !  The console is awesome. You made it way less frightenning than a bash shell. My comments may be beyond the scope of the demos.

### About Links

To me bookmarks are useless if I can not give them context to find my content days/weeks/.../years later. I currently use the very minimalistic [pinboard service](https://pinboard.in/u:emak/) and I think tags (or their equivalent transposed in urbit concepts) are a must have for a bookmarking service. And of course a search or filtering engine among those tags is required.

### ... and Feed

Then I wonder if the the reading interfaces for bookmarks and social status (Feed) data structures could somehow converge? As I understand it: in the `:talk` parlance the backend of Link (at least the public bookmarks) and Feed would both rely on `%journal` stations.

I'd like to be able to subscribe to someone's public bookmarks feed, even more I'd like to subscribe only to someone's bookmarks with a certain set of tags.

Urbit gives us the ability to compose data that were previoulsy siloed in different services. By breaking those barriers I'd like to explore the opportunities
* to increase the `signal / noise` ratio
* to improve the user quality of attention by reducing the potential for distraction
