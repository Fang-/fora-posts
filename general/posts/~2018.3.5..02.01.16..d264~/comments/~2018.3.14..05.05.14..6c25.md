Hello. This is not quite related but I'm changing my home machine and I tried to boot up my star using my ticket again. 

I'm doing something along the lines of urbit -w ~STARNAME -t ~TICKET

But all I get is:
zsh: no such user or named directory: STARNAME

It worked this way before, but that was a while ago, what should I do now?
