Parser combinators are basically the best thing ever, and I love them to death. That being said, the problem with them is discoverability - there have been multiple times where I've searched the stdlib for a string function that does <x> only to realize that I can do it with a combinator.

(x is frequently "split on character" which is `(scan "a b c d" (most ace alf))`, btw)
