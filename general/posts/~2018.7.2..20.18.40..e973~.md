From https://urbit.org/posts/constitution/:

" An independent star is any star not owned by anyone who is either a senator, or has some connection to one that would pose a conflict of interest."

"A primary planet is the main planet of a unique human (no sockpuppets)."

How would this be achieved without verifying real-life IDs?
