I successfully compiled urbit from the master branch today, but I had to install an additional package in Ubuntu before the `make` command ran successfully. Before installing `libuv1-dev`, I received the following error after running `make` from the root urbit folder:

```vere/main.c:13:16: fatal error: uv.h: No such file or directory
 #include <uv.h>
                ^
compilation terminated.```

Everything ran smoothly after installing `libuv1-dev`. Not sure if anyone has experienced this error before, but thought I'd mention it here. Note also that my computer *did* have the regular, automatic `libuv1` package installed prior to receiving the error.
