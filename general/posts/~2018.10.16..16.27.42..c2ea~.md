Greetings!

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this topic, but I'll give it a shot anyway -- if it is not, I apologize, and trust that the orderlies will dispose of it promptly. 

I will be writing a Master Thesis in Computer Science and Engineering in the spring of 2020. This includes a research project spanning 20 40-hour weeks, and an academic paper describing the project. The idea of selecting as a subject something related to Urbit occurred to me, and that is why I am now posting here in order to gather some suggestions for potential research subjects. 

I'm sure I'm not the only CS student with an Urbit interest, so with some luck, it might be beneficial to others, too.  In any case - thanks in advance!
