We should not underestimate the power of worse is better. People go to great lenghts to avoid paying for stuff. what would happen is that 80% of starts would not run stuff that's not absolutely necessary for get people to pay. And this would also mean the app is useless. If you can only reach 20% of urbits, your app will die a sad death.
