To be clear, there aren't going to be any tokens, just ownership of Urbit addresses. The Constitution contract will provide standardized ways of transferring ownership of these things though. (ie, ERC20, ERC721)

On the legal side of things, we've made sure to have our things in order. Whatever that entails exactly I can't say because I simply have no idea. Last I heard (which was when SEC announced their crack-down) address space wasn't a security?
