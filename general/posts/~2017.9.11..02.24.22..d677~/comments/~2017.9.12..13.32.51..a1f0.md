A doc style change that would really help me (and possibly others) is: when doing line by line breakdowns of a hoon app or similar multi line chunk of code,  arrange the web docs so that example code is visible *alongside* the explanatory text. Having to scroll up and down all the time to look at the code being described really breaks the flow of comprehension. Opening another browser window does the job, but having something like this fora layout, with the example code on the left and text on the right could really help newbies I feel.
