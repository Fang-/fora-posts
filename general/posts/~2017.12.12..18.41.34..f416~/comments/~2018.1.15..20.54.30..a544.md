Hey `~lidtud`. You shouldn't have a problem booting your new planet if you boot per our [setup doc](https://urbit.org/docs/using/setup), given you still have your original planet ticket (which we originally would have sent to your email). Is this what you have been trying? If you can provide as much information as possible, we can get this all worked out!
