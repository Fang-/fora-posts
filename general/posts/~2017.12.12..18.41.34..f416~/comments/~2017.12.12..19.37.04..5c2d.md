Hey ~divmec. This seems weird. Did you build your urbit binary from the latest master source? It looks like it, as your interpreter is registering the `urbit-0.5.1` version number. Where are you running this from -- your laptop, or a cloud instance? And what are your CPU and memory numbers looking like?

Let's get this figured out!
