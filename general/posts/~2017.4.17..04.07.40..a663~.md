All,

Newbit (?) here. Have been attempting to follow the /docs/arvo/{security-drivers.md,api.md} and hit some roadblocks. I can do basic auth on github, but as soon as I try do authorize via oauth2 and make any request, I get a [%e %vi %pump-blocked /com/github 3] error, which basically deads any attempt to make http(s) calls to github from dojo.

Two questions: 1) Is there any way to "unblock" whatever this pump is? I'm on my second comet here, since I can't trace the error.

2) I've been trying to pick my way through this, hoping to help build out some connectors. Is this a fool's errand due to something more fundamental changing? I got the sense from :talk that this area of the docs might have gone to seed.
