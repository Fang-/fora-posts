Hey ~litpyx, I'm pretty sure ~taglux lives in Texas, actually. Not sure what happened there at the top of this thread-- apparently ~taglux's evil twin ship with the exact same name lives somewhere in LA area though. Ha!  

I do sense another LA Urbit meetup brewing, though. I know of at least a few guys who would be interested. Might as well do roll call while we're here: Who's interested in another LA meetup, perhaps early 2018? Anyone have a venue in mind?
