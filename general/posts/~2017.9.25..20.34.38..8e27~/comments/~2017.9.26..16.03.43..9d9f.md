I can't support this decision. The arguments are weak, and I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and think you're misinformed about ETH.

I'd have respected this decision if you said you're doing it for the money-shot, because putting that money to use advancing urbit would have been a good thing. I see no benefit to the decision other than endorsing ETH, and that leads to suspicion.
