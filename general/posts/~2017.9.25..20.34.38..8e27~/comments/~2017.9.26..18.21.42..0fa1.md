Tools that you really need to use for Ethereum work for any of the forks. ETH and ETC is just different history of transactions after one particular block, not the blockchain itself. Of course it's possible to create a tool that will check content of that particular block and work only if it contains ETH transactions. And maybe there is a reason for that particular check, but it also means you probably don't need it for ETC as a tool author wanted to deal with some specific transaction, contract or other external content which exists only in ETH blockchain history.

All other tools, like compilers, debuggers, testing, js libraries, web3js, truffle, and everything an average developer need, it works for both chain, for ETH and for ETC. The tool usually can't even distinguish which chain it's targeted, and don't need to care because there countless private chains based on top of Ethereum, and all of the are using same tooling.

Think about Redhat and Centos, but there it's even more close.
