So, the way this works is that the owner of a galaxy or star can "launch" stars or planets. This means they say "I give [Ethereum address] ownership of this child, and they can start using it right now". This is a task you can always do manually.

To facilitate auctions and other transactions, you can also grant specific Ethereum addresses (in most cases, a contract address) the right to launch ships for you. This can be any arbitrary Ethereum address. You can either use one of our supplied and audited auction/sale contracts (of which you put your own instance onto the blockchain), or write your own.
