The "strongest computational blockchain" indeed doesn't make a lot of sense. Blockchains are enforced by its consensus rules, and everyone are free to choose which consensus rule they want to follow.

If want Urbit argued was true, then there'll never be Bitcoin Cash, never segwit1x, segwit2x, never the ETH/ETC split. Besides, the argument even just go as far as Proof of Work chains. When it comes to PoS and other type of blockchains, computation just isn't the first thing that matters.

It's better to talk about whether a consensus rule is "vulnerable to attack". In this sense, Ethereum is probably not a good choice due to its historic records. People learn lessons, but it happens slowly. After DAO attack we have Parity multi-sig hack, ERC20 token lost, etc, etc. (Fun fact is that Parity multi-sig hack does not affect ETC chain, so ETC is one incident less than ETH.)

Also, Urbit is not a blockchain, even if you argue it is, it was never a Proof of Work blockchain. Building Urbit on a current PoW Ethereum chain will just make it slower. So in this sense, it's not a step forward, it's a step backward.

Besides, Urbit never answers my concerns about decentralization: what is more decentralized? A PKI system (building on Ethereum) that can only be validated by a few galaxy nodes due to its huge size? Or a PKI system that is plain text written in every Urbit client that everyone can validate?
