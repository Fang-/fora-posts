~labsem, I'm not sure I understand your question. Brokers don't get discovered.

When you send a message, you target an audience: one or more stations. A `station` is a `(pair ship knot)`, so all we do is send a `%poke` move directed at `[p.station %talk-broker]`, "the talk broker on that ship". Whether or not that ship is running a talk broker, or even alive at all, is none of our concern. The user said they wanted to send something there, and talk being the faithful messenger it is complies without asking questions.
