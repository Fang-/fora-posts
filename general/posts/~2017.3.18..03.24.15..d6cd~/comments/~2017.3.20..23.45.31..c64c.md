## `~tonret-sigsur`
This has been fixed! At least a good-enough working version for what I was trying to accomplish. Definitely keep the conversation going if you think there are still interface improvements to be made to `%gall` or `%eyre`, or anything of course. :)

P.S. Still taking name suggestions! Don't be shy!
