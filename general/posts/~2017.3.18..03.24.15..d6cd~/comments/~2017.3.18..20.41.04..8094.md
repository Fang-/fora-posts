You can add a namespace to any app -- here's a sneak peak from my (woefully incomplete) app docs:

```
++  peek
  |=  a/path
  :: ^-  (unit (unit (pair mark *)))
  ~&  [%peek a]
  [~ ~ %urbit ~zod]
```

Assuming your app is called "test":

```
> .^(@p %gx /=test=/something/urbit)
[%peek /x/something]
~zod
```

If `++peek` produces `[~ ~]`, that means the request will never be resolved. But
if it just produces `~`, that means "wait". %gall will subscribe to the app, for you
and the dojo will block until the request is resolved (or canceled with
backspace).

```
++  peek
  |=  a/path
  ~&  [%peek a]
  ~
::
++  peer-scry
  |=  a/path
  ~&  [%peer-scry a]
  :-  [[ost.bow %diff %urbit ~nec] ~]
  ..peer-scry
```

```
> .^(@p %gx /=test=/something/urbit)
> [%peek /x/something]
>> [%camping %g %x [p=~zod q=%test r=[%da p=~2017.3.18..20.38.41..2fb3]] s=/urbit/something]
[%peer-scry /x/something]
~nec
```
