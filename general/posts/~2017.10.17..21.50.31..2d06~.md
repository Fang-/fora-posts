There was an interesting discussion in urbit-meta last week:

```
~poldec-tonteg+ is there a parser like scot/scot, but renders in
~poldec-tonteg+ "non-german-style"
~poldec-tonteg# (scow %ux `@ux`100.000)  "0x1.86a0"

~poldec-tonteg+ tryna sign these headers and i don't need this punctuation
~poldec-tonteg+ messing it up
~pittyp-datfyn# (scan "12345" dem)  12.345
~rovnys-ricfer+ ~poldec you mean you want to parse numbers that don't include 
~rovnys-ricfer+ dots?

~rovnys-ricfer+ or do you mean you want to print a number without dots?
~pittyp-datfyn+ for the other way, uh
~poldec-tonteg+ number no dots
~pittyp-datfyn# (slag 2 (scow %ui 12.345))  "12345"
~poldec-tonteg+ sorry meant formatter

~pittyp-datfyn# (pojo (jone 12.345))  "12345"
~pittyp-datfyn+ the former is based on
~pittyp-datfyn# <`@ui`12.345>  "0i12345"
~tonlur-sarret+ i didn't even know we had a @ui aura.
~rovnys-ricfer+ me neither, what is that

~poldec-tonteg+ everyone's learning!
~taglux-nidsep+ man i wish i knew about that stuff months ago
~pittyp-datfyn+ "no dots" :p
~taglux-nidsep+ this is great
~rovnys-ricfer+ ah

~pittyp-datfyn+ oh also
~pittyp-datfyn# (*d-co:co 12.345)  "12345"
~rovnys-ricfer+ i guess it would be weird if there was something that hoon 
~rovnys-ricfer+ *didn't* have a syntax for
~poldec-tonteg+ `@ux`100.000

~pittyp-datfyn# ((d-co:co 7) 12.345)  "0012345"
~poldec-tonteg+ ^^whoops
~poldec-tonteg+ knowledge is being extremely dropped
~rovnys-ricfer+ ~pittyp says ++co is the coin core
~pittyp-datfyn+ actually wait you're better off with a-co

~pittyp-datfyn# (*d-co:co 0)  ""
~pittyp-datfyn# (a-co:co 0)  "0"
~rovnys-ricfer+ a coin is a url-safe constant
~rovnys-ricfer+ so there are various formatters for different data types so you 
~rovnys-ricfer+ can stick them in urls

~rovnys-ricfer+ each atom aura has a coin syntax
~rovnys-ricfer+ the $many type of coin is a url-safe format for nouns
~rovnys-ricfer+ which contains other coins, recursively
~rovnys-ricfer+ so you can serialize any noun into a url
~poldec-tonteg+ holy hoon.hoon

~pittyp-datfyn# ._1_2_3__  [1 2 3]
~pittyp-datfyn# (scot %f 0)  ~..y
~pittyp-datfyn# (scot %ta %foo)  ~.~.foo
~rovnys-ricfer+ what's the inverse of ++scot?
~pittyp-datfyn+ slay for the generic one

~poldec-tonteg+ so how would i make a hex into a dotless cord or tape?
~pittyp-datfyn# (slay '.y')  [~ [%$ p=[p=~.f q=0]]]
~pittyp-datfyn# (slay '12')  [~ [%$ p=[p=~.ud q=12]]]
~ravmel-ropdyl/ [http://www.paglen.com/index.php?l=work&s=cube&i=0](http://www.paglen.com/index.php?l=work&s=cube&i=0)
~ravmel-ropdyl+ it's an urbit moon

~rovnys-ricfer# (scot %ui 0x1234)  ~.0i4660
~pittyp-datfyn+ slav and slaw for specific types
~rovnys-ricfer+ oh, no
~pittyp-datfyn# (slav %f '.n')  1
~poldec-tonteg+ oh yes

~rovnys-ricfer+ ha
~poldec-tonteg+ you see my problem, hah
~rovnys-ricfer# `@ui`0x1234  0i4660
~rovnys-ricfer+ i don't know how to get rid of the 0i
~poldec-tonteg+ you slag a scow is the best i can figure

~pittyp-datfyn# |2:"0iFOOBAR"  t="FOOBAR"
~pittyp-datfyn+ that's what the slag 2 does yeah
~rovnys-ricfer# |2:(scow %ui 0x1234)  t="4660"
~pittyp-datfyn# ((x-co:co 1) 0xabc.def0)  "abcdef0"
~pittyp-datfyn# (cuss ((x-co:co 1) 0xabc.def0))  "ABCDEF0"

~pittyp-datfyn+ if you want to be more leet
~taglux-nidsep+ someone is cussing in urbit-meta
~rovnys-ricfer# (slag 2 (scow %ui 0x1234))  "4660"
~rovnys-ricfer+ well ~poldec how many tlon devs does it take to slag a scow?

~pittyp-datfyn# (slag 2 (scow %ux 0x1234))  "1234"

~rovnys-ricfer+ 3: two to suggest potential answers, and one to post associated 
~rovnys-ricfer+ theme music

~poldec-tonteg+ ha
~pittyp-datfyn+ you'll still have the dots tho
~pittyp-datfyn+ i guess you could
~poldec-tonteg+ nah the x-co one works i think
~ravmel-ropdyl+ okay this chris brown video is insane

~pittyp-datfyn# =/(a 0x12.3456 (skip <a> |=(@ =(+< '.'))))  "0x123456"
~pittyp-datfyn+ but probably just use x-co :p
