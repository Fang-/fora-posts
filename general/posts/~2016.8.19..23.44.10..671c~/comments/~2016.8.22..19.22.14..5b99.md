Urbit can definitely replay like that, when you start up after a `kill -9` and see a bunch of `...`, each dot is an event being replayed. This is easy to see if you run `~&(%test ~)` and then `^Z` for a hard exit: It will replay all the keystrokes, and then you'll see the printf again. (HTTP requests and such don't go out again;  `~&` works because it is part of the interpreter and not a formal "side-effect" result.)
