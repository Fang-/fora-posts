Public key crypto is a wondrous thing, no? Sounds that is basically a public chain - your posts contain the hash of the current state, plus a signed addition. You can walk backwards through the hashes, verifying ever post ever made, so it doesn't matter who gives you the chain.

The problem with append-only public chains is that, uh, they are append only. So having a forum where the entire discussion is signed means that you can't edit or remove posts, except as another message saying "edit post x to y".
