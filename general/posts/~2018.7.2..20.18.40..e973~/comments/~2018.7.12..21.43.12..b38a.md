This seems like something that absolutely should not have a prescribed solution.  There are tradeoffs between the cost of verifying a person and the likelihood this person will be the source of spam or abuse or whatever.

Is the right solution for giving out a planet to someone a personal interview and credit check?  Or will a web form with a captcha suffice?  Should you be ultra-permissive and remove troublemakers promptly, or make sure they don't end up underneath your star in the first place?
