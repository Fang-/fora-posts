on Sandstorm VM needing backup: isn't this also the case for a urbit VM? I never used or installed a sandstorm vm, fogive my ignorance, is your argument that urbit doesn't need backup or that it's easier to maintain than for sandstorm?

on the EC2 reboot: I currently run my urbit off a simple cloud VM which gets reset (or maybe urbit is crashing the VM?). Isn't this a problem urbit would have as well?
