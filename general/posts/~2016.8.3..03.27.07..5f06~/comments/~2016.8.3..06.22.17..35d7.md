## `~raplys-lornex`
Forks only exist in spans, but `$?` and friends exist as twigs. So, as you've already said, every case but `%herb` is easy. But bunts of gates open to a `^~`ed invocation of the gate without any sample replacement, so they already evaluate to the gate's sample. I could be missing something, of course, but I don't think we need to ever pull the sample out of a herb.
