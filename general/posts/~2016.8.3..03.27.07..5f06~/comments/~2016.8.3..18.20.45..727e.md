I became aware of this issue a while ago and postponed it with the thought: "I'm going to have to think a little harder about this at some point."

It looks like other people are already thinking hard and are basically ahead of me on this question.  Sorry, there are a number of existing problems in the code where there's a solution in my head.  This is not one of them!  My intuition suggests that it's probably possible to get it right.  But that's all I got, so please feel free to design away.
