Yeah, I'm definitely investigating the stuff you mentioned here... the (set span) thing makes me suspicious, however.

Bunting is too ad-hoc, as you've uncovered, though we're making steps in the right direction with things like `|:`. I think you're barking up the wrong tree with stepping into codegen, though - if the tile engine knew about bunts instead of just letting them happen, and clam put them into the sample instead of just bunting noun every time, and forks were lists again and the first element of a fork bunted to bunt the whole fork, we'd be in business. The last part could still take place in macro expansion, of course.
