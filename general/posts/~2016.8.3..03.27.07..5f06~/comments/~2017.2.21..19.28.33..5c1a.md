I'm curious to hear what errors you've found in those docs -- maybe you could start a new thread?

Also, I wrote pretty extensively about molds here: [http://micnus-tarwyl-haltem-linhut--dilhul-talbes-wolnyx-lasbud.urbit.org/docs/hoon/](http://micnus-tarwyl-haltem-linhut--dilhul-talbes-wolnyx-lasbud.urbit.org/docs/hoon/). That might answer some of your questions ....
