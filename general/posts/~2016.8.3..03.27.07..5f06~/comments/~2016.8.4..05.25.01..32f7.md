## `~ladhut-docfyn`
Looks like the stack overflow while compiling %behn isn't a red herring after all. It was a pain to isolate, because a stock non-jetted ++ut can't handle the whole file. The culprits are ++sqeu and ++broq, reduced here to ++foo and ++bar:

```
=~
|%
++  unit  |*(a/_* $@($~ {$~ a}))
--
|%
++  foo  |*(a/_* {$~ (bar a)})
++  bar  |*(a/_* (unit (foo a)))
--
^~  (foo)
==
```

(The burn at the end is just a convenience to kick foo at compile-time so we don't have to manually run the nock.)

When foo is kicked, it builds the clam for `{$~ (bar a)}`, which involves computing its sample. For a bunt sample, that's going to be `[0 *(bar a)]`, so it ends up calling bar before it's even done building the clam. And since bar immediately calls foo...
