Nock operators 6 through 10 are macros that expand down to the nock operators 0 through 5. They're defined in the spec exclusively in terms of those operations -- I believe they're written that way to simplify the task of writing an interpreter. However, it's not the easiest way to understand them. If we expand the macros, they look closer to what they're doing conceptually. Here's nock 6-10 for humans:

```
*[a 6 b c d]     *[[*[a c] *[a d]] 0 *[a 4 4 b]]  ::  formula evaluates to either [0 2] or [0 3]
*[a 7 b c]       *[*[a b] c]
*[a 8 b c]       *[[*[a b] a] c]
*[a 9 b c]       *[*[a c] 0 b]
*[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
```
Compare to the original:
```
*[a 6 b c d]     *[a 2 [0 1] 2 [1 c d] [1 0] 2 [1 2 3] [1 0] 4 4 b]
*[a 7 b c]       *[a 2 b 1 c]
*[a 8 b c]       *[a 7 [[7 [0 1] b] 0 1] c]
*[a 9 b c]       *[a 7 c 2 [0 1] 0 b]
*[a 10 [b c] d]  *[a 8 c 7 [0 3] d]
*[a 10 b c]      *[a c]
```
Note that this is not a strictly correct representation of the nock spec: potential side effects from hints are not performed, and errors will show up differently. This is nevertheless a good mental model for understanding nock, unless you're working on code that uses a raw hint or performs unusually detailed error handling.
