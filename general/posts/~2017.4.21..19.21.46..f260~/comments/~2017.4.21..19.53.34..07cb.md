If you're just looking to dive deeper into the docs there is some documentation on `%eyre`, the web server here: [urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/commentary/](https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/eyre/commentary/).  I think it's pretty rough though!

It could be more helpful to check out [urbit.org/docs/arvo/web-apps/](https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/web-apps/).  Or the top-level of Arvo internals: [urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/](https://urbit.org/docs/arvo/internals/).

The part that isn't documented is that urls routed through `*.urbit.org` are actually passed first to `~binzod` (I think), and then proxied to your ship over `%ames` (Urbit's own networking).
