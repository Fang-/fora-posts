Oh, and as mentioned on the original `jael` comment convention, the `++duplicate-arm-name` 57-comments are too noisy / discourage refactoring very unhelpfully, and I'd permute

```
+-  say-goodbye                                         ::
  :>  describe product of function
  :>
  |=  :>  txt: departing friend
      :>  num: number of friends
      $:  txt/term
          num/@
      ==
```

to

```
+-  say-goodbye                                         ::
  :>  describe product of function
  :>
  :>  txt: departing friend
  :>  num: number of 
  :>
  |=  $:  txt/term
          num/@
      ==
```

if this is at all possible to implement.
