## `~pittyp-datfyn`
I think my main objection there is I don't like lone runes awash in a sea of comments: similarly with the `|%`, I'd probably define a leading armless section as pertaining to the core as a whole, and then stick the commentary on that. This is probably less of a problem under syntax highlighting, to be fair.
