Finally, I think literate programming has to have the indentation [inverted](http://pastedown.ctrl-c.us/#trz3kNoyHPfY4zvhOdCEATjBoL0.markdown), ideally rendering with commentary text  extracted from monospace the code [completely](http://pastedown.ctrl-c.us/#QqNj5NY-VpWm4zTZ6TXcSfaPs5M.markdown).

Which brings me to the `::` `:>` `:<` distinction: there are probably counterexamples I'm missing, but in `deco.hoon` every `:[:<>]` that is merely indented is a `:>`, except for the preamble whose exclusion from the "database we want to easily inspect" isn't expounded; and every `:[:<>]` that follows source code is a `:<`, except some stray `::` that may as well be included, and `:>`s on arms which could be salvaged by a ":< on an arm is equivalent to a :> on its product" rule. In a unified scheme, figuring out whether a `::` is placed as a `:>` or a `:>` might involve weird whitespace backtracking, but apparently this is the case for `:<` anyway?
