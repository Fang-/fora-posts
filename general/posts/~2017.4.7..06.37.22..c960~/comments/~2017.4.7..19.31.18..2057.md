## `~pittyp-datfyn`
I'd have chosen `+$` for consistency, but `+=` seems reasonable.

Curious why the example didn't /actually/ use homoiconic tile syntax, after hyping it up so much in the preamble; and why `$;` instead of `$,` as it was in hoon 169, or just single-argument `$:` as the formal workaround.
