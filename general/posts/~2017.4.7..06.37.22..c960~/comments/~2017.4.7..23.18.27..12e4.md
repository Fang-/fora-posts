## `~sorreg-namtyv`
Also, ~ridwex, don't misunderstand -- the help absolutely ends up in the span.  It has to be installed in the AST to get to the span.  But it's in the span, not in the source.

The reason I have to know what kind of twig it is is that I need to know whether I'm generating
`[%help stuff twig]` or `|=(* [%help stuff (twig +<)])`.  This is horrible pseudocode, but you get the idea.  Either I'm wrapping help around `twig`, or around `*twig`.  And if the latter, either I can analyze the source of `*twig` and hopefully not add this extra lambda (note that applying a face has to do the same thing), or it's something like `(pair @ @)` and I have to treat it as a black box.

But I can't do this if I have no way to distinguish between `(pair @ @)` and `(add 2 2)`.
