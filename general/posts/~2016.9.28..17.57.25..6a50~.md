So here's some things about ++og, "shax-powered rng".

[Its documentation](http://urbit.org/docs/hoon/library/3d/) is currently non-existent, so using it is kind of tough. How does this core work, what kind of input do its functions expect?

Take ++raw for example. Doing `(raw:og 5)` in dojo works, sort of. It produces the same output over and over, even though it says "random bits".  
What even if the atom sample it takes? A seed, or what? Curiously, when I tried passing `eny` as a sample instead, it bailed, and kept spinning until I aborted whatever it was doing with ctrl-c.

(In my search I did run into [the documentation for =^](http://urbit.org/docs/hoon/twig/tis-flow/ket-sip/), which contains actual information on the og core, so I now know a bit about the way og functions work, but I shouldn't have to learn that from a rune's documentation. Probably going to whip up a PR to put that tiny bit of info in the library docs later this week, unless anyone can write up a better introduction.)
