So this is fun... All the usual messages, followed by surely unheard amounts of this:
[! gall: %hood: diff: no /talk-report/drum/phat/~lodhul-ricbur/talk  [%ap-lame %hood %diff]]
>> [%mo-not-running %drum %pull]
[%ap-abut-bad-bone %talk 2]
[%ap-abut-bad-bone %talk 18]

And later on, this:
sync failed from %base on ~lodhul-ricbur to %home
please manually merge the desks with
|merge %home ~lodhul-ricbur %base

error code: %mate-conflict
[p=~lodhul-ricbur q=%base]
[p=~lodhul-ricbur q=%home]
[%ud p=17]
%mate
/app/hood/hoon
/lib/drum/hoon
sync succeeded from %base on ~lodhul-ricbur to %kids
sync succeeded from %kids on ~wanzod to %base

I'm just watching the ames spinner, and the wall of errors at this point, kinda hoping it'll fix itself. What think y'all? I've also been thinking about how I'm running a git clone of urbit from October, wondering if I should change that/what it might fix or break. Kinda feeling like the dumbest person here.

Thanks,
