Yes, timeouts are super easy to implement in this model (the timer is on the manager process, not the worker process).

This is one rare case where the mechanism is easy and the policy is tricky.  Timeout policy is clearly connected to causality -- in general, any causal channel controlled by the user should (a) have an infinite timeout and (b) an interrupt path.  This is pretty easy when we're looking at a hardware console on the same Unix box, a little harder when we're looking at a web console.

At the same time, I'm rather amazed that, even running without timeouts, infinite loops do not seem to be a major cause of urbit sinkage.  This just seems like a harder problem than it is, perhaps.

Sandboxing in a functional event system is also not hard.  Again, because renovation hasn't started on %gall, the policy here hasn't come together.  But there's really no mechanism to speak of.
