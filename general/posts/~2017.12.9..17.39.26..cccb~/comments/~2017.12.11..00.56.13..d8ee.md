Ideally, hall would offer enough control in its subscription queries that all the filtering you'd even need can be done by hall itself. One day, one day...

Of course, having a template app that implements the most common logic for apps that use hall might be nice, for bootstrapping purposes. (But then, if this turns out to be more than a handful of lines of code, you have to wonder if we can't make things simpler from a more generic level...)
