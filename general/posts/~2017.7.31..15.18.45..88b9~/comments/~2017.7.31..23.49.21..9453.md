You had almost a million events on there.  I replayed it but the replay ran out of memory around 850.000.

I'm afraid I can't do anything about this ship, and I am pretty sure what the cause is -- we have various caches which shamefully lack a reclamation model, and on our production servers we generally clear them with the |overload setting (|overload ~h12 tells the system to do a cache flush every 12 hours).  We should enable this by default.

The good news is that we're planning a breach soon (to breach in the remaint branch, which has some nontrivial protocol modifications but also doesn't suffer from connectivity bugs that break sequence-number sync, and even has a limited ability to recover from broken sequence-number sync).  So you'll at least get your name back...
