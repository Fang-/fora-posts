Well, I'm the guy who built the mockups.  And designed the video.  I've had this thought before, but it has been difficult to get it to the top of the queue in terms of importance.  

I think the visual language in the animated video could be partially repurposed here.  Perhaps that's a reasonably good starting point â€” just a few visualizations of the stack so you can understand how it fits together.  Getting to the point that you can navigate a visual explanation in tandem with actual readable docs is a pretty tough problem.  Although I could see something like [this](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/treemap/) working.

I'm not sure I share your feeling that the docs are reasonably well done.  They don't feel well enough organized.  And our introductory materials are severely lacking.  As are paths to productive contribution.  Those things are the most pressing, to me.
