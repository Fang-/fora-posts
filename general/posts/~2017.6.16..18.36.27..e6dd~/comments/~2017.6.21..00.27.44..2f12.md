> Why do `prize` units mean what they do? Would have expected ~ to mean "invalid" and [~ ~] to mean "unavailable" as opposed to the other way around.

If something is unavailable, we don't know yet if it's invalid or not. For example, think of a `.^(%cx)` file on another ship which may or may not exist.
