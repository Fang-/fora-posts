As you have learned, we can't send code over the wire. Even if we could, there is no guarantee the client's state contains all we need to execute that function. Let's take talk for example: most clients will want to store the `prize`'s list of messages, but they're not required to. Some lightweight clients may just want to render them and then forget about them. Reading the incoming stream of `rumor`s is all they need for this.

> I think needing to check whether the prize has changed should be pushed down a layer into gall, instead of expecting application developers to do this themselves for each subscription.

How would Gall do this though? It could just run `++peek` for both old and new state, and see if there's a difference. But then if there is a difference, it would still need to run a developer-written `++feel` because `delta`s don't always map directly to `rumor`s. And if you're implementing a "delta-to-rumor" function, then that's going to want to check how the current situation applies to specific queries anyway, since results might be subtly different.  
I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't immediately see a way for Gall to take care of this for the developer, since it's application-specific logic. Am I missing something?
