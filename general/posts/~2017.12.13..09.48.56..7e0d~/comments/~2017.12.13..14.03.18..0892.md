~divmec-panfex here. This thing looks like a dream come true. The main thing to which I'm eagerly looking forward is the ability to edit existing source code in the web interface. Sounds like that will have to wait for the Clay integration. 

UI looks good so far, is there any particular aspect you are unsure about?
