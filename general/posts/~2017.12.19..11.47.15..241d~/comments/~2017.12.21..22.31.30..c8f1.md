Ha! Yes. 

It's certainly possible for you to just ignore what we're doing and do your own thing. In the case of what I have seen with Plato, that's more or less the direction you're headed, right? Happy to provide specific advice on how to do this.

Or, if you want to integrate Plato into our pages I can help you do that. In that case it'll need to be a React component â€” but you can write it in anything that compiles to JS. The API for building components that plug in to Tree / future Tree is pretty simple.
