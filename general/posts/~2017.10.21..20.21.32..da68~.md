Greetings, Urbit Republic!

I'm looking to learn more about Urbit and then make that acquired understanding commensurable with my knowledge of another architecture: Ceptr (and its sub-projects Holochain & Holo).

http://ceptr.org
http://holo.host
http://holochain.org

Is there somebody who's willing to hop on a call with me and articulate Urbit, and respond to questions. I'd love to then do the same with the Ceptr thing and see where we go.

Warning: I'm new to the whole Urbit thing and therefore am unfamiliar with the forum structure too. Any responses may fruitfully be directed towards my email at author@moritzbierling.com.

Cheers!

Moritz Bierling
