If you want to look at the overall structure of a hoon file, here's a helpful grep command (I first saw ~pittyp do this, and I've just adapted it slightly):
```
grep '++\|+-\||%\||_\||^\|--' arvo/clay.hoon > clay-structure.hoon
```
Here's a snippet from the output file:
```
|%                                                    ::
++  call                                              ::  handle request
++  doze
++  load
  =>  |%
      ++  cult-0  (map duct rove)
      ++  dojo-0  (cork dojo |=(a/dojo a(qyx *cult-0)))
      ++  rede-0  (cork rede |=(a/rede a(qyx *cult-0)))
      ++  room-0  (cork room |=(a/room a(dos (~(run by dos.a) dojo-0))))
      ++  rung-0  (cork rung |=(a/rung a(rus (~(run by rus.a) rede-0))))
      ++  raft-0  
      ++  axle    $%({$0 ruf/raft-0} {$1 ruf/raft})
      -- 
++  scry                                              ::  inspect
++  stay  [%1 ruf]
++  take                                              ::  accept response
++  rant-to-rand
++  mode-to-soba

```

Note that this isn't 100% perfect: you'll sometimes see false positives in comments, and this won't show you gates or traps. It will give you a pretty good idea of the structure of a hoon file, though. This is mostly useful for understanding large files like the ones you see in the kernel, which sometimes have multiple levels of nested cores.

Let's break down that grep command, in case you want to improve on it:
```
grep '++\|+-\||%\||_\||^\|--'  file.hoon
```
The `++` and `+-` match arm definitions. Note that once doccords land, we'll need to add `+=` to these. The `|%`, `|_`, and `|^` match core definitions, for which `--` is the terminator. These are all delimited by `\|`, which means "or" since we're using `grep` with single quotes.

Happy grepping.
