Because of the mark/build system, if you want `%eyre` to serve HTML you have to specify it in the path, i.e. visit `ship.urbit.org/pages/index.html`, not `/index`.

But also, if you ask `%eyre`/`%ford` for HTML and not markdown, `:tree` won't tree-ify things, so you can just put your files in `/web` instead of `/web/pages`. So your URL can just be `https://ship.urbit.org/index.html`.

For that reason, I usually name my "index" HTML file for my examples apps after the name of the app itself. Like `https://ship.urbit.org/feed.html`, or `/mesh.html`.

Does all this work for your app if you try it?
