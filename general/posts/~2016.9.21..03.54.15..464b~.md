server: ubuntu server 14.04

step by step the problem:

- whithin the period of 10+ hours I got many times abruptly disconnected from the server (via ssh) due to shitty local ISP connection
- *last message I got after each disconnetion :* `packet_write_wait: Connection to ***.***.***.***: Broken pipe`
- then I installed **mosh** as a possible sollution
- tried to re-start my planet
- I got this error: `record (tablun-famlys/.urb/code.~mocnev-tonrec) is corrupt (j)` *(I am afraid I don't this first log)*
- then I replaced this file from a back up I did last night
- I tried restarting and got this error: `record (tablun-famlys/.urb/egz.hope) is corrupt (j)`

- then I replaced this file and tried to restart and got the message that logs seems off and I should contact an authority :-p

checkpoint and log disagree! las:19086 old:20538
Some events appear to be missing from the log.
Please contact the authorities, and do not delete your pier!

Any ideas?
