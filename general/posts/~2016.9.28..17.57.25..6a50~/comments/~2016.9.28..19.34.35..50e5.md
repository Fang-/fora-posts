## `~master-morzod`
`++og` is a door, a multi-armed core *with a sample*  -- `(~(rad og eny) 10)` produces a pseudorandom number less-than 10. The `++og` core is designed to seeded with entropy. Being *pseudorandom*, it's deterministic, based on its seed; for any given atom of entropy, it'll produce the same "random" number.

To generate multiple random numbers, use `++rads:og`, which produces a pair: the atom, and an updated `++og` core. The documentation for `=^` gives some nice examples.
